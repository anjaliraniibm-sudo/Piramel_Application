"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/crinetics-breaks-commercial-barrier-fda-nod-oral-acromegaly-drug-palsonify","Crinetics breaks commercial barrier with Palsonify FDA nod","After nearly two decades in the endocrine scene, Crinetics is making its commercial debut with the approval of a game-changing treatment for the rare growth disorder acromegaly.||The FDA on Thursday signed off on Crinetics’ paltusotine—now christened Palsonify—as a first-line treatment for adults with acromegaly for whom surgery didn’t work or isn’t an option.||The drug is a selectively targeted somatostatin receptor type 2 agonist. Unlike other somatostatin drugs that make up the bulk of current acromegaly care options, Palsonify is a small molecule, non-peptide therapy that can be taken orally, freeing up patients from frequent and often painful injections.||The treatment marks the “next level of care for patients with acromegaly,” Scott Struthers, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Crinetics, said in a recent interview with Fierce Pharma, staking that claim on the drug’s ability to both help control patients’ hormone levels and address their symptoms in a once-daily treatment option.||Acromegaly is a rare condition caused by a benign tumor in the pituitary gland, which causes the brain to overproduce growth hormone. That excess growth hormone moves into the bloodstream and prompts the liver to make too much insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which in turn causes overgrowth of patients’ tissues.||The condition is similar to gigantism in children, but, because the bones in adults who develop acromegaly have already stopped growing, the hands, feet and face often become bigger instead.||The condition can also lead to joint problems and cause a person’s heart to grow, leading to cardiovascular issues and other negative health effects, Struthers explained.||“I’ve talked to now dozens of patients with acromegaly for a long, long time, and the problem is that the current standard of care doesn’t do a great job of controlling those symptoms,” he said.||The current standard for acromegaly care following potential pituitary surgery involves somatostatin drugs, which use a naturally occurring peptide to inhibit growth hormone. But those treatments must be injected monthly in a process that can be both painful for the patient and difficult for the healthcare practitioner administering the shot, Struthers explained.||LIGHTHOUSE AT PIER 61, NEW YORK CITY||Crinetics secured Palsonify’s FDA approval with data from its PATHFNDR-1 and -2 phase 3 trials, which looked at the drug’s safety and efficacy in acromegaly patients who were previously treated and medically untreated, respectively. Palsonify delivered quick and reliable biochemical control of the disease and demonstrated sustained efficacy in both studies, Crinetics said in a Sept. 25 press release.||Patients who received Palsonify also reported significant reductions in acromegaly symptoms like headaches, joint pain, sweating, fatigue, weakness, swelling and numbness or tingling, as measured by the FDA-aligned Acromegaly Symptom Diary.||Analysts at Leerink Partners called those data “compelling” in a preapproval note to clients this week, adding that they expect Palsonify to offer patients a meaningful convenience edge “without sacrificing efficacy.”||Crinetics expects to make the drug available in the U.S. by “early October” and says it is working with payers, healthcare providers and patient advocacy groups to ensure “broad access” to Palsonify. The company has also rolled out a patient support program known as CrinetiCARE. Crinetics did not disclose Palsonify’s price in its approval announcement.||Palsonify’s FDA approval marks Crinetics’ first, propelling the company into the commercial realm, where the Leerink team figures Crinetics can “provide a foundation upon which they can continue to expand into the larger indications in the pipeline.”||To hear Struthers tell it, the Palsonify green light—and Crinetics’ pivot from clinic to market—is a story many years in the making.||“This is a huge transition,” he said ahead of the drug’s approval Thursday. “We incorporated in the late fall of ’08, then we bootstrapped until 2015 with no institutional financing, and then, since ’15 with our series A, we’ve been growing the company, and this will just be the first of what I hope is many launches.”||Unlike many smaller drug developers that choose to license out products or sell themselves to larger pharma outfits, Crinetics is piloting its Palsonify launch solo, with the goal to use sales of its new drug to support the rest of its pipeline, Struthers explained. The company has enlisted local drugmaker Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho to help codevelop and co-commercialize the drug in Japan but is otherwise keeping hold of the reins to the asset.||Crinetics is currently looking at an estimated addressable market of 11,000 patients with acromegaly in the U.S., although there are likely more people out there who could benefit from Palsonify, Struthers said.||“There’s 19,000 diagnosed acromegaly patients total, and it takes 5 to 10 years to get diagnosed from when the symptoms started to show up,” he explained. “So, we estimate another roughly 15,000 [are] yet to be diagnosed.”||To help bridge that diagnosis gap, Crinetics will be supplementing its Palsonify launch with “a lot of education, patient finding [and] helping patients ask for medical care,” Struthers added.||Meanwhile, in terms of industry receptivity to Palsonify, Crinetics has been deeply embedded within the endocrine community from its inception, Struthers noted. In turn, key opinion leaders are already well aware of Crinetics, the CEO said.||The Leerink team wrote in its note that it was “intrigued by [Crinetics’] strong relationships with the endocrinology community,” labeling Struthers as a “guru in the endocrine space … surrounded by many leaders who are also very well respected in the field.”||“With strong connections to key sites and experts, Crinetics has the potential for a solid launch,” the analysts added.||As for how those launch efforts are playing out, Crinetics began hiring medical liaisons last year, who are now out in the field doing education work and talking to physicians, Struthers said. The CEO added that the company has also finished onboarding and training its sales force, which numbers about 30 representatives, according to the Leerink team.||“I think we’ve got good awareness out there, and I think there’s a lot of anticipation on this drug,” Struthers said.||“We started out with four people and two dogs, and now we’re at almost 600 people, and I don’t know how many dogs,” Struthers reflected at the end of the interview, making sure to point out, “we’re a dog-friendly workplace.”||Aside from acromegaly, Crinetics is also developing paltusotine in carcinoid syndrome, which is a proposed complication of neuroendocrine tumors. The drug is currently in phase 3 testing in that indication.||The company also has several other promising assets in its pipeline, including atumelnant in congenital adrenal hyperplasia and Cushing’s syndrome, and a non-peptide drug conjugate in neuroendocrine tumors, among others.||Fierce Pharma Fierce Biotech Fierce Healthcare Fierce Life Sciences Events Advertise About Us Pharma Manufacturing Marketing Special Reports Fierce 50 Trending Awards Resources Events Subscribe PHARMA Crinetics breaks the commercial barrier with FDA nod for oral acromegaly med Palsonify By Fraiser Kansteiner Sep 25, 2025 5:30pm Crinetics U.S. FDA FDA approval acromegaly After nearly two decades in the endocrine scene, Crinetics is making its commercial debut with the approval of a game-changing treatment for the rare growth disorder acromegaly.

FEATURED AWARDS GALA Join us in honoring the Fierce 50 of 2025 NOVEMBER 20, 2025 LIGHTHOUSE AT PIER 61, NEW YORK CITY Register Palsonify tablets (Crinetics) Crinetics secured Palsonify’s FDA approval with data from its PATHFNDR-1 and -2 phase 3 trials, which looked at the drug’s safety and efficacy in acromegaly patients who were previously treated and medically untreated, respectively. Palsonify delivered quick and reliable biochemical control of the disease and demonstrated sustained efficacy in both studies, Crinetics said in a Sept. 25 press release. Patients who received Palsonify also reported significant reductions in acromegaly symptoms like headaches, joint pain, sweating, fatigue, weakness, swelling and numbness or tingling, as measured by the FDA-aligned Acromegaly Symptom Diary. Analysts at Leerink Partners called those data “compelling” in a preapproval note to clients this week, adding that they expect Palsonify to offer patients a meaningful convenience edge “without sacrificing efficacy.” Crinetics expects to make the drug available in the U.S. by “early October” and says it is working with payers, healthcare providers and patient advocacy groups to ensure “broad access” to Palsonify. The company has also rolled out a patient support program known as CrinetiCARE. Crinetics did not disclose Palsonify’s price in its approval announcement.  Heading to market  Palsonify’s FDA approval marks Crinetics’ first, propelling the company into the commercial realm, where the Leerink team figures Crinetics can “provide a foundation upon which they can continue to expand into the larger indications in the pipeline.” To hear Struthers tell it, the Palsonify green light—and Crinetics’ pivot from clinic to market—is a story many years in the making. “This is a huge transition,” he said ahead of the drug’s approval Thursday. “We incorporated in the late fall of ’08, then we bootstrapped until 2015 with no institutional financing, and then, since ’15 with our series A, we’ve been growing the company, and this will just be the first of what I hope is many launches.” Unlike many smaller drug developers that choose to license out products or sell themselves to larger pharma outfits, Crinetics is piloting its Palsonify launch solo, with the goal to use sales of its new drug to support the rest of its pipeline, Struthers explained. The company has enlisted local drugmaker Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho to help codevelop and co-commercialize the drug in Japan but is otherwise keeping hold of the reins to the asset. Crinetics is currently looking at an estimated addressable market of 11,000 patients with acromegaly in the U.S., although there are likely more people out there who could benefit from Palsonify, Struthers said. “There’s 19,000 diagnosed acromegaly patients total, and it takes 5 to 10 years to get diagnosed from when the symptoms started to show up,” he explained. “So, we estimate another roughly 15,000 [are] yet to be diagnosed.” To help bridge that diagnosis gap, Crinetics will be supplementing its Palsonify launch with “a lot of education, patient finding [and] helping patients ask for medical care,” Struthers added. Meanwhile, in terms of industry receptivity to Palsonify, Crinetics has been deeply embedded within the endocrine community from its inception, Struthers noted. In turn, key opinion leaders are already well aware of Crinetics, the CEO said. The Leerink team wrote in its note that it was “intrigued by [Crinetics’] strong relationships with the endocrinology community,” labeling Struthers as a “guru in the endocrine space … surrounded by many leaders who are also very well respected in the field.” “With strong connections to key sites and experts, Crinetics has the potential for a solid launch,” the analysts added. As for how those launch efforts are playing out, Crinetics began hiring medical liaisons last year, who are now out in the field doing education work and talking to physicians, Struthers said. The CEO added that the company has also finished onboarding and training its sales force, which numbers about 30 representatives, according to the Leerink team. “I think we’ve got good awareness out there, and I think there’s a lot of anticipation on this drug,” Struthers said. RELATED FDA stymies Camurus' hormonal disorder drug due to 3rd-party manufacturing issues “We started out with four people and two dogs, and now we’re at almost 600 people, and I don’t know how many dogs,” Struthers reflected at the end of the interview, making sure to point out, “we’re a dog-friendly workplace.”  Aside from acromegaly, Crinetics is also developing paltusotine in carcinoid syndrome, which is a proposed complication of neuroendocrine tumors. The drug is currently in phase 3 testing in that indication. The company also has several other promising assets in its pipeline, including atumelnant in congenital adrenal hyperplasia and Cushing’s syndrome, and a non-peptide drug conjugate in neuroendocrine tumors, among others.

In a Thursday evening post on the social media site Truth Social, President Donald Trump said that starting Oct. 1, branded drugmakers that aren't building U.S. facilities will be subject to a 100% tariff on imported medicines. Amgen, for its part, has been on U.S. investment blitz as of late. Early this month, the company revealed a $600 million investment in its home city of Thousand Oaks, California, for a new R&D center that will host hundreds of employees. On the manufacturing side of the business, the past year has seen Amgen reveal plans for a $900 million expansion in Ohio and a $1 billion project in North Carolina. The company isn't alone, of course, as many large drugmakers work to shore up their domestic supply chains and avoid the threat of punishing tariffs. Between the likes of AbbVie, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Biogen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Gilead Sciences, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Regeneron, Roche and Sanofi, the industry's U.S. investment pledges have tallied into the hundreds of billions of dollars.

"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/crinetics-breaks-commercial-barrier-fda-nod-oral-acromegaly-drug-palsonify","Crinetics breaks commercial barrier with Palsonify FDA nod","After nearly two decades in the endocrine scene, Crinetics is making its commercial debut with the approval of a game-changing treatment for the rare growth disorder acromegaly.||The FDA on Thursday signed off on Crinetics’ paltusotine—now christened Palsonify—as a first-line treatment for adults with acromegaly for whom surgery didn’t work or isn’t an option.||The drug is a selectively targeted somatostatin receptor type 2 agonist. Unlike other somatostatin drugs that make up the bulk of current acromegaly care options, Palsonify is a small molecule, non-peptide therapy that can be taken orally, freeing up patients from frequent and often painful injections.||The treatment marks the “next level of care for patients with acromegaly,” Scott Struthers, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Crinetics, said in a recent interview with Fierce Pharma, staking that claim on the drug’s ability to both help control patients’ hormone levels and address their symptoms in a once-daily treatment option.||Acromegaly is a rare condition caused by a benign tumor in the pituitary gland, which causes the brain to overproduce growth hormone. That excess growth hormone moves into the bloodstream and prompts the liver to make too much insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which in turn causes overgrowth of patients’ tissues.||The condition is similar to gigantism in children, but, because the bones in adults who develop acromegaly have already stopped growing, the hands, feet and face often become bigger instead.||The condition can also lead to joint problems and cause a person’s heart to grow, leading to cardiovascular issues and other negative health effects, Struthers explained.||“I’ve talked to now dozens of patients with acromegaly for a long, long time, and the problem is that the current standard of care doesn’t do a great job of controlling those symptoms,” he said.||The current standard for acromegaly care following potential pituitary surgery involves somatostatin drugs, which use a naturally occurring peptide to inhibit growth hormone. But those treatments must be injected monthly in a process that can be both painful for the patient and difficult for the healthcare practitioner administering the shot, Struthers explained.||Crinetics secured Palsonify’s FDA approval with data from its PATHFNDR-1 and -2 phase 3 trials, which looked at the drug’s safety and efficacy in acromegaly patients who were previously treated and medically untreated, respectively. Palsonify delivered quick and reliable biochemical control of the disease and demonstrated sustained efficacy in both studies, Crinetics said in a Sept. 25 press release.||Patients who received Palsonify also reported significant reductions in acromegaly symptoms like headaches, joint pain, sweating, fatigue, weakness, swelling and numbness or tingling, as measured by the FDA-aligned Acromegaly Symptom Diary.||Analysts at Leerink Partners called those data “compelling” in a preapproval note to clients this week, adding that they expect Palsonify to offer patients a meaningful convenience edge “without sacrificing efficacy.”||Crinetics expects to make the drug available in the U.S. by “early October” and says it is working with payers, healthcare providers and patient advocacy groups to ensure “broad access” to Palsonify. The company has also rolled out a patient support program known as CrinetiCARE. Crinetics did not disclose Palsonify’s price in its approval announcement.||Palsonify’s FDA approval marks Crinetics’ first, propelling the company into the commercial realm, where the Leerink team figures Crinetics can “provide a foundation upon which they can continue to expand into the larger indications in the pipeline.”||To hear Struthers tell it, the Palsonify green light—and Crinetics’ pivot from clinic to market—is a story many years in the making.||“This is a huge transition,” he said ahead of the drug’s approval Thursday. “We incorporated in the late fall of ’08, then we bootstrapped until 2015 with no institutional financing, and then, since ’15 with our series A, we’ve been growing the company, and this will just be the first of what I hope is many launches.”||Unlike many smaller drug developers that choose to license out products or sell themselves to larger pharma outfits, Crinetics is piloting its Palsonify launch solo, with the goal to use sales of its new drug to support the rest of its pipeline, Struthers explained. The company has enlisted local drugmaker Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho to help codevelop and co-commercialize the drug in Japan but is otherwise keeping hold of the reins to the asset.||Crinetics is currently looking at an estimated addressable market of 11,000 patients with acromegaly in the U.S., although there are likely more people out there who could benefit from Palsonify, Struthers said.||“There’s 19,000 diagnosed acromegaly patients total, and it takes 5 to 10 years to get diagnosed from when the symptoms started to show up,” he explained. “So, we estimate another roughly 15,000 [are] yet to be diagnosed.”||To help bridge that diagnosis gap, Crinetics will be supplementing its Palsonify launch with “a lot of education, patient finding [and] helping patients ask for medical care,” Struthers added.||Meanwhile, in terms of industry receptivity to Palsonify, Crinetics has been deeply embedded within the endocrine community from its inception, Struthers noted. In turn, key opinion leaders are already well aware of Crinetics, the CEO said.||The Leerink team wrote in its note that it was “intrigued by [Crinetics’] strong relationships with the endocrinology community,” labeling Struthers as a “guru in the endocrine space … surrounded by many leaders who are also very well respected in the field.”||“With strong connections to key sites and experts, Crinetics has the potential for a solid launch,” the analysts added.||As for how those launch efforts are playing out, Crinetics began hiring medical liaisons last year, who are now out in the field doing education work and talking to physicians, Struthers said. The CEO added that the company has also finished onboarding and training its sales force, which numbers about 30 representatives, according to the Leerink team.||“I think we’ve got good awareness out there, and I think there’s a lot of anticipation on this drug,” Struthers said.||“We started out with four people and two dogs, and now we’re at almost 600 people, and I don’t know how many dogs,” Struthers reflected at the end of the interview, making sure to point out, “we’re a dog-friendly workplace.”||Aside from acromegaly, Crinetics is also developing paltusotine in carcinoid syndrome, which is a proposed complication of neuroendocrine tumors. The drug is currently in phase 3 testing in that indication.||The company also has several other promising assets in its pipeline, including atumelnant in congenital adrenal hyperplasia and Cushing’s syndrome, and a non-peptide drug conjugate in neuroendocrine tumors, among others.||Fierce Pharma Fierce Biotech Fierce Healthcare Fierce Life Sciences Events Advertise About Us Pharma Manufacturing Marketing Special Reports Fierce 50 Trending Awards Resources Events Subscribe PHARMA Crinetics breaks the commercial barrier with FDA nod for oral acromegaly med Palsonify By Fraiser Kansteiner Sep 25, 2025 5:30pm Crinetics U.S. FDA FDA approval acromegaly After nearly two decades in the endocrine scene, Crinetics is making its commercial debut with the approval of a game-changing treatment for the rare growth disorder acromegaly.

"https://www.contractpharma.com/library/the-evolving-landscape-cutting-edge-approaches-for-difficult-to-deliver-molecules/","The Evolving Landscape: Cutting-Edge Approaches for Difficult-to-Deliver Molecules | Contract Pharma","Resolving solubility and permeability concerns demands the adoption of new technologies that consider performance, manufacturability, stability, and patient needs.||The pharmaceutical landscape is continuously evolving, with drug development becoming increasingly complex due to challenging molecules, accelerated clinical timelines, and limitations of existing formulation technologies. This necessitates an integrated approach to enabled intermediates and drug product design, moving beyond traditional methods to embrace innovation and strategic thinking.||Yizheng Cao, Principal Scientist in the Process and Product Development department at Serán, shares insight on challenges in oral drug delivery, drug product design, innovative formulation strategies, selecting manufacturing technologies, and resolving solubility and permeability concerns.||Contract Pharma: What are the primary challenges in oral drug delivery that necessitate new thinking and innovative formulation strategies today?||Yizheng Cao: Drug developers are now frequently tasked with designing oral products for molecules with low solubility and low permeability, including small molecules, PROTACs, peptides, and other challenging molecules. This increasing molecular complexity, coupled with compressed clinical development timelines, demands advanceable and robust formulations right from the start of development.||Contract Pharma: How has the approach to drug product design evolved to address these complex molecules and compressed timelines?||Yizheng Cao: Effective development now requires a more comprehensive and integrated approach. This means simultaneously considering drug product design and manufacturability along with the development of enabled intermediates, rather than solely focusing on the intermediate itself. A fundamental understanding of molecular properties combined with a strategic plan for drug product design can lead to effective and advanceable formulations for even the most challenging drug products. The goal is to develop a commercially relevant, advanceable formulation as early as Phase I.||Contract Pharma: Can you provide an example of innovative formulation strategies for compounds with poor solubility, particularly when traditional methods might have limitations?||Yizheng Cao: One innovative approach is the “IR+” (immediate release plus) tablet formulation. Instead of solely relying on amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) – a common approach – the IR+ tablet formulates the crystalline API with an acidulant and a precipitation inhibitor. The acidulant creates a low pH microenvironment when the tablet disintegrates in the stomach, even if the bulk gastric pH is high, thereby improving the dissolution of the crystalline API. Simultaneously, the precipitation inhibitor helps maintain supersaturation of the dissolved API as it transfers to the intestine, leading to high exposure and enhanced robustness. This simplified formulation can reduce costs, time, and risks compared to more complex processes like ASD manufacturing.||Contract Pharma: When amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) are necessary, what new considerations are there for selecting manufacturing technologies, and how do they impact drug product design?||Yizheng Cao: When ASDs are required, two well-established manufacturing technologies are spray drying (SDD) and hot melt extrusion (HME). While both are robust and scalable, their particle properties significantly influence downstream drug product design and performance.||The choice between SDD and HME depends on the specific molecule, program, and problem statement, as no single process is always superior; the pros and cons for process throughput, stability, particle engineering, bioperformance, and drug product design must be carefully considered.||Contract Pharma: What are the emerging challenges and innovative approaches for developing formulations that require permeation enhancement, especially for larger molecules?||Yizheng Cao: Integrated drug product design directly addresses the significant permeability challenges encountered with complex molecules, particularly larger ones like peptides and PROTACs. The core idea is to employ a comprehensive strategy that considers not just the components, but also their processing, manufacturability, and targeted delivery. Key strategies for overcoming permeability challenges include:||o   Spray Drying with Dry Granulation: This process begins by spray drying a dispersion of the API and enhancer, ensuring intimate mixing at a molecular level. Subsequently, a dry granulation step densifies the resulting powders, which often have poor flowability, and allows for the optional addition of more permeation enhancers.||o   Wet Granulation: An alternative is to introduce peptides and enhancers as a solution into a wet granulation process. This ensures high uniformity and composition of the elements and produces a blend with excellent flowability, achieving both intimate mixing and improved powder properties in a single step. These methods help engineer powder properties to maximize drug loading.||o   Enteric Coating: To achieve this synchronized and targeted delivery, enteric coating is often applied to drug products (capsules or tablets). This pH-triggered coating prevents drug release in the acidic stomach and allows for a rapid and simultaneous release of both the API and the permeation enhancer when the pH elevates in the intestine (e.g., pH 6.8), which is crucial for maximizing permeation enhancement.||Conclusion As new molecular therapies become increasingly complex and clinical development timelines accelerate, formulators must move beyond conventional approaches. This involves defining clear problem statements, exploring multiple feasible solutions, and often opting for simplified formulations where it is possible to reduce risks and costs. Ultimately, resolving solubility and permeability concerns of challenging molecules demands creativity and the adoption of new technologies that simultaneously consider performance, manufacturability, stability, and patient needs. Ultimately, the optimal drug product uses the simplest technologies that meet both the target product profile and the patient’s needs, emphasizing a flexible, scalable, and commercially relevant design.||A Breakthrough in Liposome-Integrated Formulations||What Biotechs Should Be Looking for Next||The Challenge of Stabilizing Injectable Biologics||Timothy Compton of Alcami shares insight on Alcami's role in ensuring a smooth transition from development to manufacturing.||Meeting Global Injectable Demand||Released By Rovi Pharma Industrial Services||David King of Samsung Biologics shares insights on market demand and the technologies and capabilities needed to support today’s drug products.||Nelson Labs Nina Moreno shares insight on rapid sterility testing, the technologies used, advantages, and regulatory considerations.||Released By Nelson Laboratories, LLC||Susan Lynch-Smith, Head of Business Development, Douglas CDMO, touts the advantages of and dispels misconceptions about mid-sized CDMOs.||Contract Pharma is the premier media outlet linking contract service providers and their pharma/biopharma sponsors.||Copyright © 2025 Rodman Media.

While both are robust and scalable, their particle properties significantly influence downstream drug product design and performance. Spray Drying (SDD): Generates small, low-density particles with a high surface area. These particles are favored for rapid dissolution, high compressibility, and can achieve higher apparent solubility due to more extensive formation of drug-polymer colloids. However, their poor flowability often requires a densification process like dry granulation for downstream processing, which then improves tabletability. SDD is material-sparing and can be used at small scales, advantageous in early development. Hot Melt Extrusion (HME): Produces larger, denser particles. These particles typically exhibit better powder flow, making them potentially suitable for direct compression. However, their compressibility and tabletability may be limited, requiring further optimization or a lower drug loading in tablets. HME is a solvent-less process but requires more material for development and low-melting point components, with a risk of thermal degradation. The choice between SDD and HME depends on the specific molecule, program, and problem statement, as no single process is always superior; the pros and cons for process throughput, stability, particle engineering, bioperformance, and drug product design must be carefully considered.

This ensures high uniformity and composition of the elements and produces a blend with excellent flowability, achieving both intimate mixing and improved powder properties in a single step. These methods help engineer powder properties to maximize drug loading. Simultaneous Release and Targeted Delivery: Effective permeation relies on the API permeating during a short window when the enhancer interacts with the intestinal membrane. o   Enteric Coating: To achieve this synchronized and targeted delivery, enteric coating is often applied to drug products (capsules or tablets).

It is dedicated to the assembly of high-volume minimally invasive catheters for electrophysiology, vascular and structural heart therapies, and other medical devices that require precision manual assembly.||Three ISO Class 7 cleanrooms are operational from day one, with plans to double the site to 100,000 square feet within the next three years — quadrupling Freudenberg Medical’s total footprint in Costa Rica.||“This new facility underlines Freudenberg Medical’s confidence in Costa Rica as an integral part of our global growth strategy,” added Róger Gómez, VP and General Manager of Freudenberg Medical Costa Rica. “In the next three years, we will grow our team from 350 to over 900 employees. Committed to diversity and inclusion, we offer equal opportunities to all, while providing meaningful careers in a growing industry that improves lives around the world.”||During 2025, the company’s existing 30,000-square-foot facility nearby will specialize in primary processing technologies, including precision molding and extrusion of thermoplastics for medical and biopharma applications, while assembly operations will be consolidated at the new site.||The Costa Rica expansion is supported by advanced digital technologies. Freudenberg Medical combines Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance operator training, streamline production processes, and enable seamless technology transfers across its global vertically integrated network.||Operators train in immersive VR environments that replicate the exact conditions of the production floor, ensuring standardization in critical processes and consistent quality across all sites. At the same time, AI-powered layout planning is used to model and optimize production flows following lean principles – minimizing waste, reducing costs, and involving customers early in the planning of future production lines.||This new facility will accommodate up to 15 biotech companies to fuel next-generation medicines.||Expands its production capabilities in North America.||The new facility has integrated and set up several solutions from Thermo Fisher’s portfolio.||Represents one of the largest commercial-scale cell culture biomanufacturing sites in North America.||Will enhance its analytical chemistry and microbiology capabilities.||Pexegra and Filra will be available with support from JAMP’s commercialization efforts in Canada.||The planned synthetic medicine active pharmaceutical product facility will focus on manufacturing the company's pipeline of small molecule medicines.||Collaboration aims to scale Rion’s proprietary exosome manufacturing platform.||Will build a center for Cell and Gene Therapy (CGT) development and manufacturing near Bangkok, in Thailand.||Appoints Sam Ricchezza as Senior Managing Advisor, Commercial Operations.||Enhance Cell Q’s capabilities to scale high-throughput sample prep, liquid-handling verification, COI/COC preservation, full-spectrum flow cytometry, and synthetic controls.||New facilities will bridge R&D and manufacturing across both the U.S. and U.K.||New site will develop APIs in the U.S. for cancer, autoimmune and other advanced therapies.||ProBioGen will oversee the design, lead the construction, and subsequently operate the 4,600-square-meter GMP manufacturing unit.||Provides the Morgpeth facility’s Formulation Development Team with an important tool for developing fixed dose combinations and modified release drug delivery.||Contract Pharma is the premier media outlet linking contract service providers and their pharma/biopharma sponsors.||Copyright © 2025 Rodman Media.

Unlike random integration or transposase methods, it reduces clone screening to dozens of candidates, supports expression stability, and shortens IND timelines.||TrueSite TI is the fourth generation of WuXi Biologics’ WuXia cell line platform, used in over 1000 molecules over the past decade. It achieves an average monoclonal antibody (mAb) titer above 8.0 g/L, suitable for commercial manufacturing. Over 99% of its clonal cell lines maintain protein stability after 60 generations, reducing titer drop risks during scale-up to over 20,000 L.||The platform supports monoclonal antibodies and complex biologics, such as bispecific antibodies, Fc-fusion proteins, and Fab fragments, with consistent cell line stability and growth profiles. Plus, it enables a six-month IND timeline for clinical trials.||Dr. Chris Chen, CEO of WuXi Biologics, commented: “WuXi Biologics continues to advance its WuXia platform, pushing the boundaries of cell line development.

"https://www.contractpharma.com/exclusives/ai-data-security-the-83-compliance-gap-facing-pharmaceutical-companies/","AI Data Security: The 83% Compliance Gap Facing Pharmaceutical Companies | Contract Pharma","Why pharma needs automated AI security now.||Chief Information Security Officer, Kiteworks||The pharmaceutical industry stands at a dangerous crossroads. While companies race to harness artificial intelligence for drug discovery, clinical trial optimization, and manufacturing efficiency, a new industry study by Kiteworks reveals a shocking truth: only 17% of organizations have implemented automated controls to prevent sensitive data from leaking through AI tools. This means 83% of pharmaceutical companies—including many contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs)—operate without basic technical safeguards while their employees paste molecular structures, clinical trial results, and patient records into ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and other AI platforms.||The report, which surveyed 461 cybersecurity, IT, risk management, and compliance professionals across industries, exposes a critical disconnect between what pharmaceutical executives believe about their AI security and what happens on the ground. This finding aligns with Stanford’s 2025 AI Index Report, which documented a 56.4% increase in AI-related security incidents in just one year. In an industry where a single leaked molecule structure can destroy billions in research investment, this gap represents not just a security concern but an existential threat to competitive advantage and regulatory compliance.||The numbers paint a sobering picture of pharmaceutical AI security. According to the Kiteworks study, the vast majority of organizations rely on dangerously inadequate measures to protect their data from AI exposure. At the top of the security pyramid, only 17% have technology that automatically blocks unauthorized AI access and scans for sensitive data—the bare minimum for protection in today’s environment.||The remaining 83% depend on increasingly unreliable human-centered approaches. Forty percent rely on employee training sessions and periodic audits, essentially hoping staff will remember and follow the rules when working under pressure. Another 20% send warning emails about AI usage but never verify compliance. Ten percent have merely issued guidelines, while a startling 13% have no policies whatsoever.||This security breakdown becomes particularly alarming when considering the unique pressures facing pharmaceutical researchers. Under constant pressure to accelerate drug development timelines, scientists routinely turn to AI tools for quick analyses, literature reviews, and data interpretation. The Varonis 2025 State of Data Security Report reinforces this concern, finding that 99% of organizations have sensitive data dangerously exposed to AI tools, with 90% having sensitive files accessible through Microsoft 365 Copilot alone. A medicinal chemist might upload proprietary molecular structures to get insights on potential drug interactions. A clinical data analyst could paste patient outcomes into an AI platform to identify patterns. Each action, while well-intentioned, creates permanent risk exposure that cannot be undone.||The Kiteworks research reveals that 27% of life organizations acknowledge that more than 30% of their AI-processed data contains sensitive or private information. In pharmaceutical contexts, this represents a catastrophic level of exposure encompassing the industry’s most valuable assets.||Consider what pharmaceutical employees share with AI tools daily. Proprietary molecular structures that took years and millions of dollars to develop get uploaded for quick structural analysis. Unpublished clinical trial results, which could make or break a drug’s approval chances, are pasted into chatbots for summary generation. Manufacturing processes protected as trade secrets flow into AI systems when quality teams seek process optimization suggestions. Patient health information, ostensibly protected under HIPAA, enters public AI platforms when researchers request help with adverse event analysis.||The permanence of this exposure cannot be overstated. Unlike traditional data breaches where companies can change passwords or revoke access, information absorbed into AI training models becomes permanently embedded. As detailed in the research on AI data leakage risks, pharmaceutical companies face unique vulnerabilities from model memorization, where AI systems can inadvertently retain and later expose fragments of sensitive information like patient identifiers, diagnoses, or proprietary molecular structures—even from models that appear properly sanitized.||For pharmaceutical companies, the regulatory implications of uncontrolled AI usage create a compliance perfect storm. The Kiteworks report found that only 12% of organizations list compliance violations among their top AI concerns—a dangerous blind spot given the acceleration of regulatory enforcement. Stanford’s AI Index Report confirms this regulatory surge, documenting that U.S. federal agencies issued 59 AI-related regulations in 2024, more than double the 25 issued in 2023.||Current practices violate multiple regulatory requirements simultaneously. HIPAA demands comprehensive audit trails for all electronic protected health information (ePHI) access, yet companies cannot track what flows into shadow AI tools. FDA’s 21 CFR Part 11 requires validated systems and electronic signatures for any system handling clinical data, standards that public AI platforms cannot meet. GDPR mandates the ability to delete personal information upon request, but data embedded in AI models cannot be retrieved or removed.||The enforcement landscape continues to tighten across the globe, with Stanford reporting that legislative mentions of AI increased by 21.3% across 75 countries. These aren’t suggestions—they carry substantial penalties and potential criminal liability for executives. When regulators request documentation of AI usage during an audit, “we didn’t know” becomes an admission of negligence rather than a defense.||The traditional approach to compliance—policies, training, and periodic reviews—fails completely in the AI context. Shadow AI usage happens outside corporate visibility, often on personal devices accessing consumer AI services. The Varonis report found that 98% of companies have employees using unsanctioned applications, with each organization averaging 1,200 unofficial apps. By the time compliance teams discover violations, sensitive data has already been permanently absorbed into AI systems.||Modern drug development involves extensive partnerships with CDMOs, contract research organizations (CROs), academic institutions, and technology vendors. Each partner potentially introduces new AI tools and security vulnerabilities. Verizon’s latest Data Breach Investigations Report found that third-party involvement in data breaches doubled from 15% to 30% in just one year.||Pharmaceutical intellectual property holds extraordinary value, making it an attractive target. A single molecular structure can represent a billion-dollar drug opportunity. Clinical trial data determines market success or failure. Manufacturing processes provide competitive advantages worth protecting. When employees casually share this information with AI tools, they’re essentially publishing trade secrets on a global platform.||The Kiteworks report makes clear that human-dependent security measures have failed across every industry, including pharmaceuticals. Stanford’s AI Index Report reinforces this, showing that while organizations recognize risks—with 64% citing AI inaccuracy concerns and 60% identifying cybersecurity vulnerabilities—less than two-thirds are actively implementing safeguards. Companies must transition immediately to technical controls that automatically prevent unauthorized AI access and data exposure.||Essential elements of effective pharmaceutical AI governance start with automated data classification and blocking. Systems must recognize and prevent sensitive information—whether molecular structures, patient data, or clinical results—from reaching unauthorized AI platforms. This requires technology that operates in real-time, scanning data flows before they leave corporate control.||Continuous monitoring of AI interactions with solutions such as an AI data gateway provides the visibility pharmaceutical companies currently lack. Organizations need unified governance platforms that track every AI touchpoint across cloud services, on-premises systems, and shadow IT.||The pharmaceutical industry faces a shrinking window to address AI data leakage before catastrophic consequences arrive. With 83% of organizations operating without basic technical safeguards while hemorrhaging their most valuable data, and AI incidents increasing by 56.4% year-over-year according to Stanford’s research, the gap between perceived and actual security has reached critical levels.||The choice is stark: implement real technical controls now or face the inevitable outcomes—competitive disadvantage as trade secrets leak to rivals, regulatory penalties as violations surface, and reputational damage as patient data exposures make headlines. Public trust in AI companies has already fallen from 50% to 47% in just one year, according to Stanford’s findings.

This is an edited version of that report; please note that it was written prior to the 2024 U.S. elections.||President, Pharma & Biopharma Outsourcing Association||Last fall marked 25 years(!) since I entered the CMO sector, before it even had a “D” and became CDMO. I helped launch Contract Pharma magazine as its founding editor in the fall of 1999, and almost 15 years later I left that role to launch the Pharma & Biopharma Outsourcing Association (PBOA) so I could help CMO/CDMOs work with regulators and legislators, and better understand their peers in the industry.||Some things have stayed the same for CDMOs over that quarter-century, like private equity pressures driving M&A, and deranged product forecasts from customers. But this past year has brought some new wrinkles; whether they have staying power and signal long-term trends is the bazillion-dollar question. (The fallout of the 2024 U.S. elections is a multi-bazillion-dollar question.)||Some of the issues I covered last year remain in effect for the CDMO space. R&D funding remains constrained. While reports indicate that dollars are flowing back to late-stage assets, there is little evidence that early-stage pipeline products are receiving funding. This means that the lifeblood of CDMOs—projects moving through the development pipeline and smaller customers sticking with key service providers—remains hobbled.||Also, supply chain transparency and resiliency continue to be key concerns for FDA and other regulators and governmental bodies. FDA wants to increase its authority to compel reporting by API and finished dosage form manufacturers with the goal of better mapping the supply chain and understanding global and regional manufacturing capacities and flow.||In 2024 the U.S. Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and Department of Commerce engaged in an assessment of the U.S. Public Health Industrial Base supply chain, an initiative that includes a survey focused on API and Key Starting Materials (KSM) suppliers of a number of FDA-designated essential medicines. In this case, the goal is to both gain supply chain transparency and promote onshoring of manufacturing, another key post-COVID trend I wrote about last year.||So, what has 2024 wrought, and where do we go from here? Last year, I wrote, “When it comes to China, CDMOs, and the larger pharma sector, my Magic 8-Ball is murky. The most recent U.S. rhetoric has moved away from talk of ‘decoupling,’ but there are still trade barriers that both countries are exercising.”||Murky, it turns out, was an understatement. By early 2024, the U.S. Congress was discussing the BIOSECURE Act, which would forbid certain key government contracts, grants and loans going to companies that do business with certain China-based companies, including WuXi AppTec and WuXi Bio. By the end of 2024, the House passed BIOSECURE, but it failed to come up for a vote in the Senate and never became enacted.||In its House-passed incarnation, the bill gave companies until January 1, 2032 to cease working with any of the named firms (as well as other companies that could get added to the list), lest they become ineligible to receive certain contracts and grants under Federal Acquisition Regulations. While the “smart money” contended that it would hitch a ride with the National Defense Authorization Act, it never came up, after concerns raised in the House about due process for the named companies were echoed in the Senate.||The trajectory of BIOSECURE—from “never gonna happen” (my words, when I first heard about it in February 2024), to a rush of drug companies reaching out to alternative service providers to potentially shift work from the named companies, to “never gonna happen”—was remarkable, and even without it being enacted, its impact could be far-reaching.||The uncertainty isn’t just BIOSECURE itself, but what comes after, in terms of further U.S. steps, potential Chinese response, and other regions’ behavior. Will there be new disincentives or penalties proposed by U.S. legislators? Will there be carrots to go along with these sticks, incentivizing investment in manufacturing and services elsewhere? These and other responses will do much to shape the landscape for CDMOs and their customers.||One aspect of this that I will note is that, when BIOSECURE was first being floated, it was India-based CDMOs who drew my attention to it. And as I started outreach on it, CDMOs from that country seemed much better informed about the bill than their western counterparts. They only knew what was publicly available, but were *very* well versed in its particulars. That information-advantage dissipated over the spring trade show season, with more CDMOs telling me about increasing calls from potential customers, but I was intrigued by the notion that Indian CDMOs—and the manufacturing base overall in that country—may see BIOSECURE as an inflection point for their own position in the biopharma manufacturing ecosystem.||This all ties back to my earlier comments around supply chains and onshoring. The U.S. and other countries have been realistic about how much manufacturing can be onshored, and how much local-only manufacturing may add fragility, not resilience, to supply chains. To that end, we may see multi-regional activity to bolster supply: friend-shoring.||In June of 2024, the U.S. White House announced the formation of the Biopharma Coalition (Bio-5), including the U.S., EU, India, Japan, and South Korea. It was intended to strengthen biopharma supply chain resilience, and “will focus on building resilient supply chains for APIs currently sourced primarily from the People’s Republic of China,” per a White House statement, which went on to say, “The five countries will seek opportunities for their governments and the private sector to deepen coordination on policy, regulations, R&D capabilities, and other tools to enhance the resilience of this vital sector.”||I can neither confirm nor deny attending the Bio-5’s kickoff event, but the announced goal of building parallel API supply chains across regions could be a huge step. Whether this or another coalition will arise during the new administration is another of those bazillion-dollar questions.||BIOSECURE and geopolitics weren’t the only major factor in the CDMO space. In my previous piece, I also alluded to “a potential $50 billion market for weight-loss drugs springing up virtually overnight,” without expanding on the impact of GLP-1s on the CDMO space. Now I have to revise that to “maybe a $150 billion market,” and “that has reshaped the CDMO sector.”||The biggest direct CDMO story in 2024 was Novo Holdings’ $16.5 billion acquisition of Catalent, one of the world’s largest pure-play CDMOs, in order to sell its three fill/finish sites to Novo Nordisk for $11.5 billion, presumably for use in internal manufacturing of Wegovy and/or Ozempic or their successors. Announced in February, the deal closed 10 months later, and will (presumably) remove three large fill/finish plants from the CDMO sector—Novo Nordisk said it would honor existing contracts at those sites, but I assume they do not plan to renew those contracts. It also takes the remaining Catalent business off the public equity market, as that has become part of Novo Holdings.||That means no more quarterly financial reports from Catalent, resulting in less public information that can be gleaned—or misread or distorted, as is often the case—about the CDMO sector. And while I pride myself on the strength of my vibe-checks of the sector, this industry functions better when there’s reliable public data.||One of the questions that arose in the wake of Novo’s acquisition is whether it would lead to other biopharma companies acquiring CDMOs to capture their capacity.||While we’ve seen limited versions of this happen, especially with acquisition of CGT manufacturing capacity, I don’t believe Novo-Catalent will presage a wave of CDMO buyouts by biopharma. This move feels exceptional in terms of the specific capabilities and capacity Novo Nordisk needed, coupled with the truly mind-bending growth rate of the GLP-1 market.||Lilly has looked to build internal manufacturing to complement its current infrastructure and CDMO relationships, along with its purchase of Nexus Pharma, a non-CDMO asset, to advance its GLP-1 products, and—again, vibes—I suspect it’s too late in the game to acquire another significant source of manufacturing capacity that could become a Monjauro/Zepbound dosage-form site.||Clearly, GLP-1s have been a net positive for the CDMO sector. At a conference I attended in August, the CEO of a new-ish CDMO that’s very tech-driven admitted that his company’s move into fill/finish and GLP-1 products “saved the company.” (He’s no longer the CEO.)||But CDMOs are benefiting from more than just GLP-1 volume. While some are manufacturing these products or their competitors, and others are providing packaging and distribution services, we’re also seeing the growth in the market for products that are being displaced by GLP-1s.||Not every product needs massive scale and a prefilled syringe (PFS) dosage form. In fact, Lilly made the move to market Zepbound in a single-dose vial through its direct-to-consumer platform, which should be easier to process than PFS doses. Its CEO also speculated about marketing multi-dose vials fill/finish CDMOs in the vial space, as well as those that manufacture smaller volumes, may find themselves in high demand, especially if the customers in the Catalent facilities intended to transfer to Novo must find new CDMOs.||In the wake of the Catalent acquisition announcement, many CDMOs in the fill/finish space issued press releases about their new lines, expansion plans, and other services tied to their facilities, getting word out that the capacity exists (or will soon come online) to absorb a lot of projects, even if that capacity isn’t evenly distributed.||Uneven distribution has been a hallmark of this sector for the 25 years I’ve been around it. While the threat of another BIOSECURE (or a trade war, tariffs, and the like), the promise of GLP-1s, and the restructuring of the Catalent-Novo deal may create opportunities for some CDMOs, others may find themselves in rougher waters.||The economics of the U.S. generic market continues to create pressures for commodity oral solid dosage products, while on the high-value end, advanced modalities like cell and gene therapies continue to face hurdles with clinical results, regulatory approval and market reimbursement, pressuring CDMOs who have invested in that area.||Even with the potential for governments to (co-)invest in shifting supply chains, the CDMOs most positioned to benefit will be the ones that focus on capability over capacity, and are able to meet their customers’ needs without over-promising.||Gil Roth is the President of the Pharma & Biopharma Outsourcing Association (PBOA), a non-profit trade association advocating for the regulatory, legislative and general business interests of the CMO/CDMO sector.

At a conference I attended in August, the CEO of a new-ish CDMO that’s very tech-driven admitted that his company’s move into fill/finish and GLP-1 products “saved the company.” (He’s no longer the CEO.) But CDMOs are benefiting from more than just GLP-1 volume. While some are manufacturing these products or their competitors, and others are providing packaging and distribution services, we’re also seeing the growth in the market for products that are being displaced by GLP-1s.  Not every product needs massive scale and a prefilled syringe (PFS) dosage form. In fact, Lilly made the move to market Zepbound in a single-dose vial through its direct-to-consumer platform, which should be easier to process than PFS doses. Its CEO also speculated about marketing multi-dose vials fill/finish CDMOs in the vial space, as well as those that manufacture smaller volumes, may find themselves in high demand, especially if the customers in the Catalent facilities intended to transfer to Novo must find new CDMOs. In the wake of the Catalent acquisition announcement, many CDMOs in the fill/finish space issued press releases about their new lines, expansion plans, and other services tied to their facilities, getting word out that the capacity exists (or will soon come online) to absorb a lot of projects, even if that capacity isn’t evenly distributed. Uneven distribution has been a hallmark of this sector for the 25 years I’ve been around it. While the threat of another BIOSECURE (or a trade war, tariffs, and the like), the promise of GLP-1s, and the restructuring of the Catalent-Novo deal may create opportunities for some CDMOs, others may find themselves in rougher waters. The economics of the U.S. generic market continues to create pressures for commodity oral solid dosage products, while on the high-value end, advanced modalities like cell and gene therapies continue to face hurdles with clinical results, regulatory approval and market reimbursement, pressuring CDMOs who have invested in that area.  Even with the potential for governments to (co-)invest in shifting supply chains, the CDMOs most positioned to benefit will be the ones that focus on capability over capacity, and are able to meet their customers’ needs without over-promising.

"https://www.contractpharma.com/exclusives/ai-data-security-the-83-compliance-gap-facing-pharmaceutical-companies/","AI Data Security: The 83% Compliance Gap Facing Pharmaceutical Companies | Contract Pharma","Why pharma needs automated AI security now.||Chief Information Security Officer, Kiteworks||The pharmaceutical industry stands at a dangerous crossroads. While companies race to harness artificial intelligence for drug discovery, clinical trial optimization, and manufacturing efficiency, a new industry study by Kiteworks reveals a shocking truth: only 17% of organizations have implemented automated controls to prevent sensitive data from leaking through AI tools. This means 83% of pharmaceutical companies—including many contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs)—operate without basic technical safeguards while their employees paste molecular structures, clinical trial results, and patient records into ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and other AI platforms.||The report, which surveyed 461 cybersecurity, IT, risk management, and compliance professionals across industries, exposes a critical disconnect between what pharmaceutical executives believe about their AI security and what happens on the ground. This finding aligns with Stanford’s 2025 AI Index Report, which documented a 56.4% increase in AI-related security incidents in just one year. In an industry where a single leaked molecule structure can destroy billions in research investment, this gap represents not just a security concern but an existential threat to competitive advantage and regulatory compliance.||The numbers paint a sobering picture of pharmaceutical AI security. According to the Kiteworks study, the vast majority of organizations rely on dangerously inadequate measures to protect their data from AI exposure. At the top of the security pyramid, only 17% have technology that automatically blocks unauthorized AI access and scans for sensitive data—the bare minimum for protection in today’s environment.||The remaining 83% depend on increasingly unreliable human-centered approaches. Forty percent rely on employee training sessions and periodic audits, essentially hoping staff will remember and follow the rules when working under pressure. Another 20% send warning emails about AI usage but never verify compliance. Ten percent have merely issued guidelines, while a startling 13% have no policies whatsoever.||This security breakdown becomes particularly alarming when considering the unique pressures facing pharmaceutical researchers. Under constant pressure to accelerate drug development timelines, scientists routinely turn to AI tools for quick analyses, literature reviews, and data interpretation. The Varonis 2025 State of Data Security Report reinforces this concern, finding that 99% of organizations have sensitive data dangerously exposed to AI tools, with 90% having sensitive files accessible through Microsoft 365 Copilot alone. A medicinal chemist might upload proprietary molecular structures to get insights on potential drug interactions. A clinical data analyst could paste patient outcomes into an AI platform to identify patterns. Each action, while well-intentioned, creates permanent risk exposure that cannot be undone.||The Kiteworks research reveals that 27% of life organizations acknowledge that more than 30% of their AI-processed data contains sensitive or private information. In pharmaceutical contexts, this represents a catastrophic level of exposure encompassing the industry’s most valuable assets.||Consider what pharmaceutical employees share with AI tools daily. Proprietary molecular structures that took years and millions of dollars to develop get uploaded for quick structural analysis. Unpublished clinical trial results, which could make or break a drug’s approval chances, are pasted into chatbots for summary generation. Manufacturing processes protected as trade secrets flow into AI systems when quality teams seek process optimization suggestions. Patient health information, ostensibly protected under HIPAA, enters public AI platforms when researchers request help with adverse event analysis.||The permanence of this exposure cannot be overstated. Unlike traditional data breaches where companies can change passwords or revoke access, information absorbed into AI training models becomes permanently embedded. As detailed in the research on AI data leakage risks, pharmaceutical companies face unique vulnerabilities from model memorization, where AI systems can inadvertently retain and later expose fragments of sensitive information like patient identifiers, diagnoses, or proprietary molecular structures—even from models that appear properly sanitized.||For pharmaceutical companies, the regulatory implications of uncontrolled AI usage create a compliance perfect storm. The Kiteworks report found that only 12% of organizations list compliance violations among their top AI concerns—a dangerous blind spot given the acceleration of regulatory enforcement. Stanford’s AI Index Report confirms this regulatory surge, documenting that U.S. federal agencies issued 59 AI-related regulations in 2024, more than double the 25 issued in 2023.||Current practices violate multiple regulatory requirements simultaneously. HIPAA demands comprehensive audit trails for all electronic protected health information (ePHI) access, yet companies cannot track what flows into shadow AI tools. FDA’s 21 CFR Part 11 requires validated systems and electronic signatures for any system handling clinical data, standards that public AI platforms cannot meet. GDPR mandates the ability to delete personal information upon request, but data embedded in AI models cannot be retrieved or removed.||The enforcement landscape continues to tighten across the globe, with Stanford reporting that legislative mentions of AI increased by 21.3% across 75 countries. These aren’t suggestions—they carry substantial penalties and potential criminal liability for executives. When regulators request documentation of AI usage during an audit, “we didn’t know” becomes an admission of negligence rather than a defense.||The traditional approach to compliance—policies, training, and periodic reviews—fails completely in the AI context. Shadow AI usage happens outside corporate visibility, often on personal devices accessing consumer AI services. The Varonis report found that 98% of companies have employees using unsanctioned applications, with each organization averaging 1,200 unofficial apps. By the time compliance teams discover violations, sensitive data has already been permanently absorbed into AI systems.||Modern drug development involves extensive partnerships with CDMOs, contract research organizations (CROs), academic institutions, and technology vendors. Each partner potentially introduces new AI tools and security vulnerabilities. Verizon’s latest Data Breach Investigations Report found that third-party involvement in data breaches doubled from 15% to 30% in just one year.||Pharmaceutical intellectual property holds extraordinary value, making it an attractive target.

Manufacturing processes provide competitive advantages worth protecting. When employees casually share this information with AI tools, they’re essentially publishing trade secrets on a global platform.||The Kiteworks report makes clear that human-dependent security measures have failed across every industry, including pharmaceuticals. Stanford’s AI Index Report reinforces this, showing that while organizations recognize risks—with 64% citing AI inaccuracy concerns and 60% identifying cybersecurity vulnerabilities—less than two-thirds are actively implementing safeguards. Companies must transition immediately to technical controls that automatically prevent unauthorized AI access and data exposure.||Essential elements of effective pharmaceutical AI governance start with automated data classification and blocking.

Using a range of approaches, including AI-based computational models of toxicity and cell lines and organoid toxicity testing in a laboratory setting, the new approach aims to improve drug safety and accelerate the evaluation process, while reducing animal experimentation and lowering R&D costs.||Contract Pharma gains insight from CEOs at the forefront of building biotech companies that don’t rely on animal models and what this change might mean for the future of drug development. In the second of this two-part series, Andrei Georgescu, CEO and co-founder of Vivodyne, discusses the company’s humanized drug testing platform using lab-grown tissues that replicate patient physiology, key advantages, and how the industry is working to advance more ethical, efficient, and scalable preclinical innovation.||Contract Pharma: Please describe Vivodyne’s human-first models and how they compare to animal studies?||Andrei Georgescu: Vivodyne human-first models are lab-grown human tissues that replicate the complexity of real human organs — down to all the appropriate cell types and their micro- and macroarchitecture, perfusability through blood vessels, immune function, and more, to a degree where they are indistinguishable from biopsies of native tissue. Vivodyne has developed a platform that uses primary human-derived cells to grow these living tissues by letting them use their biological programming to self-assemble into their native tissue counterparts over the course of about a week, at which point they stabilize and maintain the native function of the human tissue from which they originated. We then use these tissues to directly test new drugs, use functional genomics to modulate genes and discover novel targets, probe for rare adverse effects among diverse patient subpopulations, to assess efficacy and safety against different stages of a particular disease, and more. Vivodyne human tissues provide translatable mechanistic insights and clinical predictions that animal studies often miss, due to the very differences in biological function that makes them different from humans.||The genetic differences that cause mice, dogs, and other animals to be (quite evidently) distinct from humans come as the accumulated product of minute perturbations scattered throughout our genomes, and it is so difficult to predict whether these perturbations will accumulate to allow some specific animal results to translate to humans or not. Given drugs that yield safe and often effective results in animals have a 93% failure rate in human clinical trials, it’s clear that predicting the manifestation of these differences is still an insurmountable challenge to clinical translation.||Unlike these animal models, Vivodyne’s approach to preclinical human testing directly captures human physiological function and responses to drugs in health and disease — for toxicity and efficacy. We can observe whether healthy human tissues become damaged, and if diseased human tissues become healthier when dosed with a therapeutic candidate. And we can see these responses manifest across many orders of complexity, from individual cells signaling to their neighbors, to the complex organ-scale signaling that underlies a disease. This insight deeply reduces translational risk, identifies safety risks earlier, allows us to accelerate efficacious targets and drug candidates, and the vast scale of our automation accelerates the discovery and development of safer and more effective medicines.||Contract Pharma: What does the FDA’s policy shift mean for biotech R&D timelines and regulatory approval?||Andrei Georgescu: The FDA’s recent openness to alternatives to animal testing, including human tissue models and predictive AI, signals a transformative shift in drug development. It opens the door to faster, more clinically relevant R&D timelines by allowing human data-derived evidence to drive early-stage decisions and IND submissions alike.||For companies like Vivodyne, this means that the rapid adoption that we have seen by a majority of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies is encouraged. Make no mistake; the FDA is strongly evidence-based and has made these decisions in consultation with our very partners. We are excited to enable IND approvals that are attained more rapidly and with lower translational risk, to see fewer late-stage failures that cost many hard years of effort, and ultimately, to enable safer, more effective, and more affordable therapies to reach patients even sooner.||Contract Pharma: What potential drug products would this impact?||Andrei Georgescu: Nearly every category of drug development stands to benefit, but especially the main category that the FDA has identified: precision medicines like biologics, which comprise antibodies, cell therapies, immuno-oncology drugs, and others that depend on the exceptional specificity of these modalities to their human targets — targets for which animals either do not possess a homolog, or whose equivalent target participates differently in signaling pathways than it does in humans.||For example, immunotherapies often show promise in animals but don’t translate to human efficacy or suffer from serious cytokine storms or other safety risks to which mice and even nonhuman primates are not predisposed. The complex immunological complexity of our human tissues provides direct human insights and data that predict how these therapies will behave in people. In Vivodyne’s partnerships, we’re already seeing direct, human-predictive successes in using our human tissues to predict cytokine release syndrome and vasculitis, immunotoxicity and immunosuppression, fibrosis risk, inflammatory responses, and disease-specific therapeutic efficacies for a wide range of precision medicines, biologics, and cell therapies.||Contract Pharma: How is the industry moving toward more ethical, efficient, and scalable preclinical innovation?||Andrei Georgescu: The convergence of biology, automation, and AI is making scalable human-first drug testing a reality. Vivodyne is at the forefront of this shift — we’ve fully automated the complex, rigorous testing of thousands of human tissues in parallel to yield exceptionally rich data that you could previously only obtain from clinical human biopsies, with insight extraction and analysis powered by our active learning and integrative multimodal AI pipelines.||This enables us and our partners to discover novel human biology and prosecute new drug targets, screen candidate compounds against those targets more efficiently, prioritize leads with higher confidence, and dramatically reduce reliance on animals. More importantly, it aligns rapid technological innovation with an improvement in patient outcomes, by merging the two: the innovation is in quite literally testing on patient cell-derived human tissues before testing on those patients to maximize clinical translatability. And ethically, this allows us to directly yield human data without relying on hospital-sized animal vivariums that still have only a fraction of the testing capacity that our platforms do. As regulators, investors, and society continue to push for better science and ethics, we are excited to drive advancement in the ability to harness deep, rich human data before clinical trials.||Andrei Georgescu, is CEO and co-founder of Vivodyne, a biotech developing humanized drug testing platforms using lab-grown tissues that replicate patient physiology.

"https://www.contractpharma.com/top-company-profile/pfizer/","Pfizer | Contract Pharma","66 Hudson Boulevard East, New York, New York, 10001-2192||We’re celebrating 175 years of daring scientific innovation—and we’re not done yet. Every day, we’re channeling our passion and resources into delivering innovative therapies that change the face of healthcare. Let’s outdo yesterday.||Headcount: 88,000 Revenues: $63,627 (+7%) Net Income: $8,031  (+>100%) R&D: $10,822 (+1%)||Pfizer’s 2024 fiscal year marks a transitional period for the pharmaceutical giant as it moves beyond the pandemic-fueled windfall of 2021-2022 and charts a new path forward centered around oncology, innovation, and internal transformation.||The company reported $63.6 billion in total pharmaceutical revenue in 2024, up 7% from $59.6 billion in 2023—its first year-over-year revenue gain since COVID-19-related sales began to recede. Notably, this rebound occurred despite the continued falloff in sales of its pandemic blockbusters, Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Comirnaty fell to $5.35 billion (from $11.22B in 2023), while Paxlovid brought in $5.72 billion (up from $1.28B in 2023 due to U.S. government stockpile delivery).||Removing pandemic product contributions, Pfizer’s base business saw meaningful growth, led by top sellers like Eliquis ($7.37B), Prevnar family vaccines ($6.41B), Vyndaqel/Vyndamax ($5.45B), and Ibrance ($4.37B). Nurtec ODT, part of the company’s growing migraine franchise, also grew to $1.26 billion, nearing blockbuster territory. Net income rose sharply to $8.03 billion, up from just $2.1 billion in 2023.||Pfizer made headlines in late 2023 when it closed its $43 billion acquisition of Seagen, a leader in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). That acquisition now anchors Pfizer’s oncology ambitions, a therapeutic area the company is aggressively expanding. Seagen brought with it four marketed ADCs—including Padcev (which earned $1.59B in 2024 revenue under Pfizer)—and a pipeline of next-generation ADC candidates that significantly bolster Pfizer’s position in cancer therapy.||In a complementary move, Pfizer licensed HBM9033, an MSLN-targeted ADC from Nona Biosciences, underscoring its interest in novel ADCs and leveraging Seagen’s R&D infrastructure. The company aims to double the number of patients treated with its oncology medicines by 2030 and is investing heavily in AI-driven drug development tools to meet this ambitious goal.||After a sharp drop in demand for COVID-19 antivirals, Pfizer launched a major cost realignment program in late 2023 that included layoffs, site closures, and operational streamlining. These initiatives are expected to yield long-term savings and improve efficiency as Pfizer focuses on higher-value therapeutics.||In manufacturing, Pfizer signed a long-term strategic agreement with Samsung Biologics to provide large-scale manufacturing support for multiple biologics, including biosimilars in oncology, inflammation, and immunology. Samsung’s state-of-the-art Plant 4 facility will be used to support Pfizer’s commercial production needs.||Additionally, Pfizer established a new operating segment called “Business Innovation,” which includes its CDMO arm, Pfizer CentreOne, and Pfizer Ignite, a bespoke R&D outsourcing service for select biotech partners. This strategic pivot positions Pfizer not only as a developer of its own products, but also as a service provider to external innovators—an interesting evolution in the Big Pharma model.||Pfizer secured several notable drug approvals in 2024, continuing a productive regulatory stretch following its nine new molecular entity (NME) approvals in 2023. New approvals in 2024 included Beqvez (fidanacogene elaparvovec), a gene therapy for adults with moderate to severe hemophilia B. Approved in April 2024, it represents Pfizer’s leap into the gene therapy space, a significant milestone in precision medicine.||Tanvelig (ritlecitinib) was approved in January for alopecia areata in adults and adolescents. Tanvelig is a once-daily oral JAK3/TEC kinase inhibitor and marks the first treatment specifically for adolescents with the condition.||Velsipity (etrasimod) gained EU approval for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, complementing its 2023 U.S. approval.||Lastly, Pfizer expanded use of Abrysvo, its RSV vaccine, already approved in older adults, for maternal immunization to protect infants.||During the year, Pfizer also gained several key supplemental approvals and label expansions, including pediatric indications for Ngenla and new combination use for Braftovi + Mektovi in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.||In 2024, Pfizer submitted regulatory filings for several high-priority programs, including: Giroctocogene fitelparvovec for hemophilia A (partnered with Sangamo Therapeutics) submitted to EMA and FDA; and Danuglipron, an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist for type 2 diabetes and obesity, submitted for Phase III studies after promising early-stage results.||The company’s Phase III pipeline includes: Elranatamab, a BCMA-targeting bispecific antibody for multiple myeloma, a potential competitor to CAR-T and other immunotherapies; RSVpreF, an expanded pediatric study for RSV prevention in younger populations, aimed at reinforcing Pfizer’s leadership in vaccines; and Modi-001, a novel T-cell receptor therapy for triple-negative breast cancer, reflecting the Seagen integration and growing immuno-oncology emphasis.||Pfizer reported more than 30 late-stage (Phase III or registration) programs across oncology, vaccines, rare disease, inflammation, and metabolic disorders. The company’s strategy is to focus pipeline investment on products with either first-in-class or best-in-class potential—particularly in areas with high unmet need and where accelerated regulatory pathways may be available.||Pfizer continued its strategy of enhancing internal R&D with external innovation in 2024, inking multiple collaborations Among the most significant was its expanded alliance with the AI-driven precision medicine company, Tempus. The partnership provides access to Tempus’ multimodal patient data and AI tools for oncology R&D, clinical trial matching, and companion diagnostics.||A collaboration was formed with Ginkgo Bioworks to discover RNA-based drug candidates using Ginkgo’s proprietary RNA technology platforms.||With Flagship Pioneering, a $100 million joint initiative to incubate and develop up to 10 novel therapeutic programs based on Flagship’s early-stage portfolio companies was started. Pfizer has options to acquire successful assets after proof-of-concept and has committed to milestone and royalty payments up to $700 million per program.||Pfizer also deepened its cardiovascular pipeline through a licensing and research agreement with Riparian Pharmaceuticals, focused on novel targets for heart disease.||2024 served as a proving ground for Pfizer’s post-pandemic identity—one that places equal emphasis on scientific innovation, external collaboration, and operational rigor.||With a leaner cost base, increased cash flow, and renewed focus on oncology and rare disease, Pfizer appears poised for sustainable growth. The Seagen acquisition and its expanding biologics and gene therapy portfolios position the company well to compete across next-generation therapeutic modalities.||While challenges remain—especially pricing pressures, regulatory uncertainty, and the slow erosion of legacy drug revenues—Pfizer’s pipeline, partnerships, and strategic manufacturing investments offer strong signals of long-term competitiveness.||As the company navigates 2025, all eyes will be on how quickly Pfizer can turn its robust pipeline into commercial blockbusters and reclaim some of the valuation it shed post-COVID. If the company’s execution in 2024 is any indicator, Pfizer’s evolution from pandemic juggernaut to innovation-driven pharma powerhouse is well underway.||Contract Pharma is the premier media outlet linking contract service providers and their pharma/biopharma sponsors.||Copyright © 2025 Rodman Media.

Additionally, Pfizer established a new operating segment called “Business Innovation,” which includes its CDMO arm, Pfizer CentreOne, and Pfizer Ignite, a bespoke R&D outsourcing service for select biotech partners. This strategic pivot positions Pfizer not only as a developer of its own products, but also as a service provider to external innovators—an interesting evolution in the Big Pharma model. Key 2024 Drug Approvals Pfizer secured several notable drug approvals in 2024, continuing a productive regulatory stretch following its nine new molecular entity (NME) approvals in 2023. New approvals in 2024 included Beqvez (fidanacogene elaparvovec), a gene therapy for adults with moderate to severe hemophilia B. Approved in April 2024, it represents Pfizer’s leap into the gene therapy space, a significant milestone in precision medicine. Tanvelig (ritlecitinib) was approved in January for alopecia areata in adults and adolescents. Tanvelig is a once-daily oral JAK3/TEC kinase inhibitor and marks the first treatment specifically for adolescents with the condition. Velsipity (etrasimod) gained EU approval for moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, complementing its 2023 U.S. approval. Lastly, Pfizer expanded use of Abrysvo, its RSV vaccine, already approved in older adults, for maternal immunization to protect infants. During the year, Pfizer also gained several key supplemental approvals and label expansions, including pediatric indications for Ngenla and new combination use for Braftovi + Mektovi in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Pipeline Momentum In 2024, Pfizer submitted regulatory filings for several high-priority programs, including: Giroctocogene fitelparvovec for hemophilia A (partnered with Sangamo Therapeutics) submitted to EMA and FDA; and Danuglipron, an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist for type 2 diabetes and obesity, submitted for Phase III studies after promising early-stage results. The company’s Phase III pipeline includes: Elranatamab, a BCMA-targeting bispecific antibody for multiple myeloma, a potential competitor to CAR-T and other immunotherapies; RSVpreF, an expanded pediatric study for RSV prevention in younger populations, aimed at reinforcing Pfizer’s leadership in vaccines; and Modi-001, a novel T-cell receptor therapy for triple-negative breast cancer, reflecting the Seagen integration and growing immuno-oncology emphasis. Pfizer reported more than 30 late-stage (Phase III or registration) programs across oncology, vaccines, rare disease, inflammation, and metabolic disorders. The company’s strategy is to focus pipeline investment on products with either first-in-class or best-in-class potential—particularly in areas with high unmet need and where accelerated regulatory pathways may be available. Collaborations & Alliances Pfizer continued its strategy of enhancing internal R&D with external innovation in 2024, inking multiple collaborations Among the most significant was its expanded alliance with the AI-driven precision medicine company, Tempus. The partnership provides access to Tempus’ multimodal patient data and AI tools for oncology R&D, clinical trial matching, and companion diagnostics. A collaboration was formed with Ginkgo Bioworks to discover RNA-based drug candidates using Ginkgo’s proprietary RNA technology platforms. With Flagship Pioneering, a $100 million joint initiative to incubate and develop up to 10 novel therapeutic programs based on Flagship’s early-stage portfolio companies was started. Pfizer has options to acquire successful assets after proof-of-concept and has committed to milestone and royalty payments up to $700 million per program. Pfizer also deepened its cardiovascular pipeline through a licensing and research agreement with Riparian Pharmaceuticals, focused on novel targets for heart disease. Looking Ahead 2024 served as a proving ground for Pfizer’s post-pandemic identity—one that places equal emphasis on scientific innovation, external collaboration, and operational rigor. With a leaner cost base, increased cash flow, and renewed focus on oncology and rare disease, Pfizer appears poised for sustainable growth. The Seagen acquisition and its expanding biologics and gene therapy portfolios position the company well to compete across next-generation therapeutic modalities. While challenges remain—especially pricing pressures, regulatory uncertainty, and the slow erosion of legacy drug revenues—Pfizer’s pipeline, partnerships, and strategic manufacturing investments offer strong signals of long-term competitiveness. As the company navigates 2025, all eyes will be on how quickly Pfizer can turn its robust pipeline into commercial blockbusters and reclaim some of the valuation it shed post-COVID. If the company’s execution in 2024 is any indicator, Pfizer’s evolution from pandemic juggernaut to innovation-driven pharma powerhouse is well underway.

Every day, we’re channeling our passion and resources into delivering innovative therapies that change the face of healthcare. Let’s outdo yesterday. Key Personnel NAME JOB TITLE Dr. Albert Bourla Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sally Susman Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, Executive Vice President Payal Sahni Becher Chief People Experience Officer, Executive Vice President Mike McDermott Chief Global Supply Officer, Executive Vice President Aamir Malik Chief U.S. Commercial Officer, Executive Vice President Doug Lankler General Counsel, Executive Vice President Rady Johnson Chief Compliance, Quality and Risk Officer, Executive Vice President Alexandre de Germay Chief International Commercial Officer, Executive Vice President Lidia Fonseca Chief Digital and Technology Officer, Executive Vice President Mikael Dolsten, M.D., Ph.D. Chief Scientific Officer, President, Pfizer Research & Development Dave Denton Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Chris Boshoff, FRCP, FMedSci, Ph.D Chief Oncology Officer, Executive Vice President Andrew Baum, BM ChB Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer, Executive Vice President Yearly results 2025 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 Sales: 63.6 Billion Headcount: 88,000 Revenues: $63,627 (+7%) Net Income: $8,031  (+>100%) R&D: $10,822 (+1%) Pfizer’s 2024 fiscal year marks a transitional period for the pharmaceutical giant as it moves beyond the pandemic-fueled windfall of 2021-2022 and charts a new path forward centered around oncology, innovation, and internal transformation. The company reported $63.6 billion in total pharmaceutical revenue in 2024, up 7% from $59.6 billion in 2023—its first year-over-year revenue gain since COVID-19-related sales began to recede. Notably, this rebound occurred despite the continued falloff in sales of its pandemic blockbusters, Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Comirnaty fell to $5.35 billion (from $11.22B in 2023), while Paxlovid brought in $5.72 billion (up from $1.28B in 2023 due to U.S. government stockpile delivery). Removing pandemic product contributions, Pfizer’s base business saw meaningful growth, led by top sellers like Eliquis ($7.37B), Prevnar family vaccines ($6.41B), Vyndaqel/Vyndamax ($5.45B), and Ibrance ($4.37B). Nurtec ODT, part of the company’s growing migraine franchise, also grew to $1.26 billion, nearing blockbuster territory. Net income rose sharply to $8.03 billion, up from just $2.1 billion in 2023. Seagen Integration Pfizer made headlines in late 2023 when it closed its $43 billion acquisition of Seagen, a leader in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). That acquisition now anchors Pfizer’s oncology ambitions, a therapeutic area the company is aggressively expanding. Seagen brought with it four marketed ADCs—including Padcev (which earned $1.59B in 2024 revenue under Pfizer)—and a pipeline of next-generation ADC candidates that significantly bolster Pfizer’s position in cancer therapy. In a complementary move, Pfizer licensed HBM9033, an MSLN-targeted ADC from Nona Biosciences, underscoring its interest in novel ADCs and leveraging Seagen’s R&D infrastructure. The company aims to double the number of patients treated with its oncology medicines by 2030 and is investing heavily in AI-driven drug development tools to meet this ambitious goal. Restructuring & Scaling-Up After a sharp drop in demand for COVID-19 antivirals, Pfizer launched a major cost realignment program in late 2023 that included layoffs, site closures, and operational streamlining. These initiatives are expected to yield long-term savings and improve efficiency as Pfizer focuses on higher-value therapeutics. In manufacturing, Pfizer signed a long-term strategic agreement with Samsung Biologics to provide large-scale manufacturing support for multiple biologics, including biosimilars in oncology, inflammation, and immunology. Samsung’s state-of-the-art Plant 4 facility will be used to support Pfizer’s commercial production needs. Additionally, Pfizer established a new operating segment called “Business Innovation,” which includes its CDMO arm, Pfizer CentreOne, and Pfizer Ignite, a bespoke R&D outsourcing service for select biotech partners.

The combined strengths of pharmaceuticals and diagnostics under one roof have made Roche the leader in personalised healthcare – a strategy that aims to fit the right treatment to each patient in the best way possible.||Headcount: 104,000 Year Established: 1896 Pharma Revenues: $51,114 (+9%) Net Income: $10,171 (-26%) R&D: $16,942 (8%)||Roche navigated fiscal 2024 with confidence, returning to growth in its pharmaceutical division despite the lingering drag of lost COVID-related sales. The company reported $51 billion in prescription pharmaceutical revenue, up 9% from the prior year—even after absorbing a $5.4 billion decline in pandemic-driven product sales. The resurgence was powered by the momentum of newer blockbusters across multiple therapeutic areas, reinforcing Roche’s strategy to shift focus toward differentiated medicines in high-need areas.||Roche’s pharma rebound came largely from the performance of recently launched products, notably Vabysmo, Ocrevus, Hemlibra, Phesgo, and Polivy—which together delivered $17.5 billion in sales, up $5.1 billion over 2023. Vabysmo, for retinal disorders, continued its rapid ascent with $3 billion in sales, making it one of the fastest-growing drugs in Roche’s portfolio since its 2022 debut.||Ocrevus for multiple sclerosis brought in $7.6 billion, up 16% with continued global expansion. Hemlibra (hemophilia A) posted $4.9 billion, up 19%, fueled by strong U.S. uptake. Oncology stalwarts Perjeta ($4.5 billion) and Tecentriq ($4.4 billion) remained stable, with the latter seeing 11% growth across geographies. Meanwhile, Polivy, used in blood cancer, nearly doubled its revenues to $900 million, bolstered by approvals in additional indications.||However, legacy oncology franchises continued to erode under biosimilar pressure. Combined sales of MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin, and Avastin declined by $1.3 billion. Lucentis, once a dominant ophthalmology brand, fell 52% in the U.S. due to biosimilar competition.||Despite these headwinds, Roche’s strategy to diversify across neurology, immunology, ophthalmology, and hematology continues to deliver. The neuroscience portfolio climbed 16%, aided by growth in Evrysdi and Enspryng. In immunology, Actemra/RoActemra saw 7% growth even as COVID-related hospitalizations waned, while Esbriet declined sharply due to generic entrants.||In 2024, Roche secured regulatory approvals for several key therapies. Vabysmo expanded its global footprint with additional approvals, particularly in Japan and Europe, strengthening its leadership in retinal care. Polivy gained full FDA approval in combination with R-CHP for previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), marking the first advancement in first-line treatment for this cancer type in over two decades.||The company also advanced regulatory filings for RVT-3101, a novel anti-TL1A antibody for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease acquired through the Telavant deal. Additionally, filings progressed for a subcutaneous formulation of Tecentriq, enhancing patient convenience in oncology care.||Roche continues to advance its pipeline with more than a dozen Phase III readouts expected in 2025. Among the highlights is RVT-3101, an anti-TL1A antibody in late-stage trials for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. With dual anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic mechanisms, it has the potential to reshape IBD care.||Assets from Roche’s $2.9 billion acquisition of Carmot Therapeutics brought a pipeline of GLP-1/GIP dual agonists into its metabolic disease platform. These subcutaneous drugs could play a critical role in the fast-growing obesity and diabetes markets.||Lastly, zilebesiran (Alnylam), an RNAi therapeutic targeting hypertension is in Phase 2 and advancing in partnership, potentially representing a new frontier in cardiovascular disease.||Roche is also conducting trials in high-priority oncology and neuroscience indications, including Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s disease, and hematologic malignancies.||Roche made two major pipeline-enhancing acquisitions in the past fiscal year. In October 2023, Roche acquired Telavant from Roivant and Pfizer for $7.1 billion, gaining full rights to RVT-3101. In December 2023, the company paid $2.9 billion for Carmot Therapeutics, securing access to three clinical-stage candidates in obesity and diabetes—a strategic play to enter the high-growth metabolic space.||On the manufacturing front, Roche plans to exit the Vacaville, CA Genentech site, signaling a shift away from legacy infrastructure toward more agile manufacturing capabilities tailored to its future pipeline. This move is consistent with Roche’s strategy to modernize its production network in alignment with a growing portfolio of complex biologics and targeted therapies.||Additionally, Roche opened its new Innovation Center in Basel, Switzerland in 2024.

The company reported $51 billion in prescription pharmaceutical revenue, up 9% from the prior year—even after absorbing a $5.4 billion decline in pandemic-driven product sales. The resurgence was powered by the momentum of newer blockbusters across multiple therapeutic areas, reinforcing Roche’s strategy to shift focus toward differentiated medicines in high-need areas. Roche’s pharma rebound came largely from the performance of recently launched products, notably Vabysmo, Ocrevus, Hemlibra, Phesgo, and Polivy—which together delivered $17.5 billion in sales, up $5.1 billion over 2023. Vabysmo, for retinal disorders, continued its rapid ascent with $3 billion in sales, making it one of the fastest-growing drugs in Roche’s portfolio since its 2022 debut. Ocrevus for multiple sclerosis brought in $7.6 billion, up 16% with continued global expansion. Hemlibra (hemophilia A) posted $4.9 billion, up 19%, fueled by strong U.S. uptake. Oncology stalwarts Perjeta ($4.5 billion) and Tecentriq ($4.4 billion) remained stable, with the latter seeing 11% growth across geographies. Meanwhile, Polivy, used in blood cancer, nearly doubled its revenues to $900 million, bolstered by approvals in additional indications. However, legacy oncology franchises continued to erode under biosimilar pressure. Combined sales of MabThera/Rituxan, Herceptin, and Avastin declined by $1.3 billion. Lucentis, once a dominant ophthalmology brand, fell 52% in the U.S. due to biosimilar competition. Despite these headwinds, Roche’s strategy to diversify across neurology, immunology, ophthalmology, and hematology continues to deliver. The neuroscience portfolio climbed 16%, aided by growth in Evrysdi and Enspryng. In immunology, Actemra/RoActemra saw 7% growth even as COVID-related hospitalizations waned, while Esbriet declined sharply due to generic entrants. Approvals, Filings & Pipeline Progress In 2024, Roche secured regulatory approvals for several key therapies. Vabysmo expanded its global footprint with additional approvals, particularly in Japan and Europe, strengthening its leadership in retinal care. Polivy gained full FDA approval in combination with R-CHP for previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), marking the first advancement in first-line treatment for this cancer type in over two decades. The company also advanced regulatory filings for RVT-3101, a novel anti-TL1A antibody for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease acquired through the Telavant deal. Additionally, filings progressed for a subcutaneous formulation of Tecentriq, enhancing patient convenience in oncology care. Roche continues to advance its pipeline with more than a dozen Phase III readouts expected in 2025. Among the highlights is RVT-3101, an anti-TL1A antibody in late-stage trials for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. With dual anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic mechanisms, it has the potential to reshape IBD care. Assets from Roche’s $2.9 billion acquisition of Carmot Therapeutics brought a pipeline of GLP-1/GIP dual agonists into its metabolic disease platform. These subcutaneous drugs could play a critical role in the fast-growing obesity and diabetes markets. Lastly, zilebesiran (Alnylam), an RNAi therapeutic targeting hypertension is in Phase 2 and advancing in partnership, potentially representing a new frontier in cardiovascular disease. Roche is also conducting trials in high-priority oncology and neuroscience indications, including Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s disease, and hematologic malignancies.

That’s why for more than 135 years, we have aimed to keep people well at every age and every stage of life. Today we are committed to using our reach and size for good. We strive to improve access and affordability, create healthier communities, and put a healthy mind, body and environment within reach of everyone, everywhere.||Headcount: 130,000 Year Established: 1886 Revenues: $88,821 (+4%) Pharma Revenues: $56,964 (+4%) Net Income: $14,066 (+5%) R&D expenses: $17,232 (+14%)||In 2024, Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceutical segment, Innovative Medicine, delivered $57 billion in revenue—a 4.3% increase over the previous year, excluding the steep decline in COVID-19 vaccine sales. J&J’s pharma business maintained its leadership position by doubling down on oncology, immunology, and neuroscience assets, while continuing to prune lower-growth legacy brands and infectious disease programs. The company’s strategic focus was made clear through targeted acquisitions, key Phase III readouts, and a steady cadence of regulatory filings and approvals.||While certain franchises felt the expected pullback from biosimilar and generic erosion, particularly Stelara and Zytiga, the strength of its newer portfolio—led by Darzalex, Carvykti, and Spravato—helped offset headwinds. Darzalex became J&J’s first drug to break the $3 billion-per-quarter barrier, while Spravato crossed the billion-dollar annual revenue mark for the first time.||In a year packed with strategic activity, J&J made nearly $50 billion in R&D and M&A investments aimed at deepening its pipeline in oncology, immunology, and neuroscience.||Notably, J&J announced the acquisition of Ambrx Biopharma for $2 billion, gaining access to a proprietary antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) platform. In May, it moved to acquire Proteologix Inc. for $850 million up front (with additional milestone potential), adding bispecific antibody candidates PX128 and PX130 targeting inflammatory skin and respiratory conditions. Shortly after, J&J secured global rights to NM26 from Numab Therapeutics for $1.25 billion. NM26, a bispecific antibody in Phase II, targets IL-4Rα and IL-31 and aims to reset the treatment paradigm in atopic dermatitis.||Beyond marquee deals, J&J also pursued a string of tuck-in acquisitions to reinforce its presence in high-growth niches. The purchase of Yellow Brick Bio, a preclinical synthetic biology firm, aimed to accelerate modular ADC development. It also acquired NeuroLeap Therapeutics for $375 million to add digital biomarkers and neuromodulation assets. These deals, though smaller in size, aligned with J&J’s focus on next-gen platforms. Additionally, J&J increased its equity stake in Legend Biotech to strengthen its CAR-T pipeline and manufacturing capacity. Collectively, these acquisitions support the company’s dual-track strategy of advancing core franchises and expanding into emerging modalities.||On the infrastructure side, J&J broke ground on a $2 billion advanced biologics manufacturing site in North Carolina.||J&J forged several new partnerships in 2024, with a continued focus on external innovation and regional expansion.||One of the year’s standout alliances was with Sanofi, aimed at co-developing and commercializing a Phase III extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC9V) vaccine candidate. Sanofi brings global scale to the table, while J&J contributes the science. J&J received a $175 million upfront payment, plus additional downstream milestone and royalty payments.||The company also joined a public-private partnership focused on developing a “pan-TB” regimen. The initiative, currently in Phase II, aims to simplify and shorten tuberculosis treatment across all forms of active pulmonary TB.||In the Asia Pacific region, J&J expanded its JLABS incubator network through a partnership with Singapore’s Economic Development Board. The collaboration seeks to stimulate biotech innovation and commercialization in Singapore and surrounding markets.||J&J earned 27 approvals for innovative medicines across major global markets in 2024 and logged 49 regulatory filings. It advanced 17 Phase III programs and notched 18 positive pivotal readouts.||Among the highest-profile U.S. FDA approvals were:||J&J’s R&D muscle was also evident in key mid- to late-stage assets. Milvexian, an oral factor XIa inhibitor in Phase III (with BMS), received FDA Fast Track in stroke, atrial fibrillation, and acute coronary syndrome. TAR-200, which received FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC bladder cancer, offers localized gemcitabine delivery via targeted release system. First targeted oral IL-23 receptor peptide, JNJ-2113, showed sustained plaque psoriasis clearance through 52 weeks in Frontier trials.||Other noteworthy Phase III efforts include: Nipocalimab in generalized myasthenia gravis and hemolytic diseases; Rybrevant + Lazcluze in confirmatory trials in EGFR-mutant NSCLC; Spravato monotherapy for drug-resistant depression; Opsumit for pediatric PAH; and NM26, a bispecific antibody in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis||Overall, the pipeline reflects a deliberate pivot toward first-in-class, durable therapies in immunology, oncology, neuroscience, and CV/metabolic diseases.||These noteworthy Phase III programs span J&J’s priority areas: immunology, oncology, neuroscience, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.||While J&J’s proprietary pipeline took center stage in 2024, its evolving global supply chain and external manufacturing investments remain essential. The $2 billion biologics facility in North Carolina reflects the company’s long-term commitment to in-house large-molecule production. Still, J&J continues to rely on select contract manufacturers, especially in complex biologics, sterile injectables, and CAR-T supply chains.||Outsourcing strategies are also embedded in its collaborations and alliances. The partnership with Sanofi on ExPEC9V is a case in point—leveraging Sanofi’s established vaccine production capacity rather than building from scratch. Meanwhile, the company’s JLABS incubators create early-stage partnerships that often tap into CDMOs for preclinical and CMC support.||In 2024, J&J expanded its strategic partnerships with contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) to support global scale-up across multiple biologics and cell therapy platforms. New multi-year agreements were signed with Lonza and WuXi Biologics to enhance capacity in Europe and Asia. In India, J&J launched a second sterile injectables line through a partnership with Gland Pharma. It also invested in modular cleanroom pods and single-use bioreactor technologies to reduce lead times and improve flexibility. These efforts not only reduce manufacturing risk but also enable rapid response to late-stage development surges and evolving global demand patterns.||As it completes its full transformation into a two-segment business—Innovative Medicine and MedTech—Johnson & Johnson entered 2025 with clarity of focus and a formidable portfolio. The spinoff of its consumer health business (Kenvue) has sharpened its strategic lens, and its capital is now firmly directed toward high-science pharma and precision MedTech.||J&J’s disciplined R&D prioritization, combined with aggressive external innovation and late-stage execution, suggest continued momentum. And with 26 platforms generating over $1 billion annually, the company has both durability and depth in its base.||This year marks a second year of success at the Pharma Industry Awards, with a win in 2024 for Large Pharma Project of the Year.||Sharon Mates, Charles Kunsch, & Pascal Touchon will help shape strategic vision, leadership, and company impact.||Medjamia is a physician and medical affairs leader with over 20 years of experience spanning biotechnology and medical devices.||Material storage ecosystem includes sites in North Carolina's RTP and Biomanufacturing Crescent Region, and the U.K.'s Golden Triangle Region.||Maier will build strategic partnerships and expand capacity and service breadth to meet growing demand for custom ssDNA manufacturing solutions.||Denis Johnson brings extensive life sciences leadership and manufacturing experience to this role.||Will enable the company to manufacture the vast majority of its advanced medicines in the U.S.||The acquisition complements Kite's expertise in cell therapy by incorporating Interius' integrating in vivo platform.||A look at the shifting strategies and surging sectors reshaping the Top 20 drugmakers.||Tracking industry leaders by Rx sales and strategic shifts.||Appoints Mari Scheiffele as EVP, Chief Product Officer; Andreas Gerber as EVP, Head of International; and Caroline Sitbon as EVP, General Counsel.||As the pharmaceutical industry continues to evolve, so too does the role of secondary packaging.||Aim to develop a scalable, end-to-end automated platform for autologous CAR-T cell manufacturing using Cellular Origins’ automated robotics platform.||How specialized expertise, advanced infrastructure, and strategic partnerships are enabling the next generation of cell-based treatments.||Contract Pharma is the premier media outlet linking contract service providers and their pharma/biopharma sponsors.||Copyright © 2025 Rodman Media.

First targeted oral IL-23 receptor peptide, JNJ-2113, showed sustained plaque psoriasis clearance through 52 weeks in Frontier trials. Other noteworthy Phase III efforts include: Nipocalimab in generalized myasthenia gravis and hemolytic diseases; Rybrevant + Lazcluze in confirmatory trials in EGFR-mutant NSCLC; Spravato monotherapy for drug-resistant depression; Opsumit for pediatric PAH; and NM26, a bispecific antibody in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis Overall, the pipeline reflects a deliberate pivot toward first-in-class, durable therapies in immunology, oncology, neuroscience, and CV/metabolic diseases. These noteworthy Phase III programs span J&J’s priority areas: immunology, oncology, neuroscience, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Outsourcing & Manufacturing Expansion While J&J’s proprietary pipeline took center stage in 2024, its evolving global supply chain and external manufacturing investments remain essential. The $2 billion biologics facility in North Carolina reflects the company’s long-term commitment to in-house large-molecule production. Still, J&J continues to rely on select contract manufacturers, especially in complex biologics, sterile injectables, and CAR-T supply chains. Outsourcing strategies are also embedded in its collaborations and alliances. The partnership with Sanofi on ExPEC9V is a case in point—leveraging Sanofi’s established vaccine production capacity rather than building from scratch. Meanwhile, the company’s JLABS incubators create early-stage partnerships that often tap into CDMOs for preclinical and CMC support. In 2024, J&J expanded its strategic partnerships with contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) to support global scale-up across multiple biologics and cell therapy platforms. New multi-year agreements were signed with Lonza and WuXi Biologics to enhance capacity in Europe and Asia. In India, J&J launched a second sterile injectables line through a partnership with Gland Pharma. It also invested in modular cleanroom pods and single-use bioreactor technologies to reduce lead times and improve flexibility. These efforts not only reduce manufacturing risk but also enable rapid response to late-stage development surges and evolving global demand patterns. Looking Ahead As it completes its full transformation into a two-segment business—Innovative Medicine and MedTech—Johnson & Johnson entered 2025 with clarity of focus and a formidable portfolio. The spinoff of its consumer health business (Kenvue) has sharpened its strategic lens, and its capital is now firmly directed toward high-science pharma and precision MedTech. J&J’s disciplined R&D prioritization, combined with aggressive external innovation and late-stage execution, suggest continued momentum. And with 26 platforms generating over $1 billion annually, the company has both durability and depth in its base.

J&J’s pharma business maintained its leadership position by doubling down on oncology, immunology, and neuroscience assets, while continuing to prune lower-growth legacy brands and infectious disease programs. The company’s strategic focus was made clear through targeted acquisitions, key Phase III readouts, and a steady cadence of regulatory filings and approvals. While certain franchises felt the expected pullback from biosimilar and generic erosion, particularly Stelara and Zytiga, the strength of its newer portfolio—led by Darzalex, Carvykti, and Spravato—helped offset headwinds. Darzalex became J&J’s first drug to break the $3 billion-per-quarter barrier, while Spravato crossed the billion-dollar annual revenue mark for the first time. Corporate Moves & Investments In a year packed with strategic activity, J&J made nearly $50 billion in R&D and M&A investments aimed at deepening its pipeline in oncology, immunology, and neuroscience. Notably, J&J announced the acquisition of Ambrx Biopharma for $2 billion, gaining access to a proprietary antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) platform. In May, it moved to acquire Proteologix Inc. for $850 million up front (with additional milestone potential), adding bispecific antibody candidates PX128 and PX130 targeting inflammatory skin and respiratory conditions. Shortly after, J&J secured global rights to NM26 from Numab Therapeutics for $1.25 billion. NM26, a bispecific antibody in Phase II, targets IL-4Rα and IL-31 and aims to reset the treatment paradigm in atopic dermatitis. Beyond marquee deals, J&J also pursued a string of tuck-in acquisitions to reinforce its presence in high-growth niches. The purchase of Yellow Brick Bio, a preclinical synthetic biology firm, aimed to accelerate modular ADC development. It also acquired NeuroLeap Therapeutics for $375 million to add digital biomarkers and neuromodulation assets. These deals, though smaller in size, aligned with J&J’s focus on next-gen platforms. Additionally, J&J increased its equity stake in Legend Biotech to strengthen its CAR-T pipeline and manufacturing capacity. Collectively, these acquisitions support the company’s dual-track strategy of advancing core franchises and expanding into emerging modalities. On the infrastructure side, J&J broke ground on a $2 billion advanced biologics manufacturing site in North Carolina. Collaborations & Alliances J&J forged several new partnerships in 2024, with a continued focus on external innovation and regional expansion. One of the year’s standout alliances was with Sanofi, aimed at co-developing and commercializing a Phase III extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC9V) vaccine candidate. Sanofi brings global scale to the table, while J&J contributes the science. J&J received a $175 million upfront payment, plus additional downstream milestone and royalty payments. The company also joined a public-private partnership focused on developing a “pan-TB” regimen. The initiative, currently in Phase II, aims to simplify and shorten tuberculosis treatment across all forms of active pulmonary TB. In the Asia Pacific region, J&J expanded its JLABS incubator network through a partnership with Singapore’s Economic Development Board. The collaboration seeks to stimulate biotech innovation and commercialization in Singapore and surrounding markets. R&D & Pipeline Momentum J&J earned 27 approvals for innovative medicines across major global markets in 2024 and logged 49 regulatory filings. It advanced 17 Phase III programs and notched 18 positive pivotal readouts. Among the highest-profile U.S. FDA approvals were: Tremfya: Expanded indication for ulcerative colitis Rybrevant + Lazcluze: First-line EGFR-mutant NSCLC combo therapy Akeega: Dual-action PARP inhibitor and abiraterone combo for BRCA+ mCRPC Talvey (talquetamab): Bispecific antibody for late-line multiple myeloma Darzalex Faspro (VRd combo): Frontline transplant-eligible multiple myeloma J&J’s R&D muscle was also evident in key mid- to late-stage assets. Milvexian, an oral factor XIa inhibitor in Phase III (with BMS), received FDA Fast Track in stroke, atrial fibrillation, and acute coronary syndrome. TAR-200, which received FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for BCG-unresponsive NMIBC bladder cancer, offers localized gemcitabine delivery via targeted release system.

"https://www.contractpharma.com/top-company-profile/amgen/","Amgen | Contract Pharma","One Amgen Center Drive Thousand Oaks, CA 91320 US||Amgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology.||Amgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its expertise to strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve people’s lives. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world’s leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential.||Headcount: 23,200 Year Establsihed: 1980 Revenues: $33,424 (+19%) Net Income: $4,090 (-39%) R&D expenses: $5,964 (+25%)||Amgen’s full-year revenues in 2024 increased 19% to $33.4 billion, largely driven by 23% volume growth. Product sales grew 19%, partially offset by 2% lower net selling price. The company’s portfolio boasts approximately 40 products spanning four therapeutic areas: General Medicine, Rare Disease, Inflammation, and Oncology. Amgen exited 2024 with 14 blockbuster products, defined as those with an annualized run rate of over $1 billion in sales. Furthermore, the company saw record sales across 21 products, with ten delivering at least double-digit sales growth, including Repatha, Tezspire, Evenity, Blincyto, and Tavneos. However, acquisition-related expenses and incremental operating expenses from Horizon impacted earnings for the year.||In 2024, Amgen invested a record $6 billion in R&D, up 25% compared to the prior year, and it has numerous potential first- or best-in-class medicines moving through its pipeline to treat obesity and obesity-related conditions, cancer, heart disease, and other serious illnesses. Additionally, the company continues to invest in growing its manufacturing network to keep pace with demand for its products.||In line with the company’s efforts to continue to distill complex disease biology into clarified targets, in November 2024, the company welcomed Howard Chang, M.D., Ph.D., as senior vice president of Research and chief scientific officer. Chang is responsible for establishing and leading all research priorities within Amgen’s rare disease, oncology, inflammation, and cardiometabolic therapeutic areas. He also oversees operations in key research hubs from San Francisco to Thousand Oaks, and across the company’s global network of specialized sites in Reykjavik, Copenhagen, Munich, British Columbia, and Maryland.||In positive pipeline news, last year, the U.S. FDA approved IMDELLTRA (tarlatamab-dlle) for the treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. IMDELLTRA received accelerated approval based on the encouraging response rate and duration of response (DoR) observed in clinical studies. Since then, IMDELLTRA was named as one of Time magazine’s Best Inventions of 2024 and has been rapidly adopted for patients facing SCLC.||The FDA also approved BLINCYTO (blinatumomab) for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients one month or older with CD19-positive Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in the consolidation phase, regardless of measurable residual disease (MRD) status. The approval marks the third indication for BLINCYTO and is based primarily on the Phase 3 E1910 clinical trial that studied patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL receiving postinduction consolidation treatment, which aims to deepen remission to achieve durable responses. Study results demonstrated that BLINCYTO added to multiphase consolidation chemotherapy showed superior overall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy alone.||In January 2025, the FDA approved LUMAKRAS (sotorasib) in combination with Vectibix (panitumumab) for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received prior fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Approval is based on the pivotal Phase 3 CodeBreaK 300 study, which demonstrated that LUMAKRAS plus Vectibix is the first and only targeted treatment combination for chemorefractory KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC to show superior progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the investigated standard-of-care (SOC).||In March, Amgen and AstraZeneca shared full results from the Phase 3 registrational WAYPOINT trial demonstrating that TEZSPIRE (tezepelumab-ekko) significantly reduced nasal polyp severity, the need for surgery and systemic corticosteroid use in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps compared to placebo.||Most recently, the FDA approved UPLIZNA as the first and only treatment for adults with Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD), a chronic and debilitating immune-mediated inflammatory condition that can affect multiple organs. The approval of UPLIZNA for IgG4-RD is supported by data from the MITIGATE trial, the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in IgG4-RD. This trial demonstrated the potential of UPLIZNA to decrease disease activity by reducing flares in patients, while maintaining its efficacy and established safety profile.||Amgen continued to invest in growing its manufacturing network with two major expansions in the past year. In December, the company announced a $1 billion expansion to establish a second drug substance manufacturing facility in North Carolina. This brings the company’s total planned investment in Holly Springs to more than $1.5 billion, building on its previously announced $550 million commitment.||The facility will incorporate innovative manufacturing technologies. In tandem with the existing facility, these investments will create 370 new jobs in the region, supporting a robust biomanufacturing hub. This expansion enhances the company’s global biomanufacturing network, operational expertise and technological advancements to ensure the reliable and efficient delivery of high-quality medicines.||Amgen also announced a $900 million expansion of its Ohio manufacturing facility, bringing the total number of jobs created to 750 and the total investment in Central Ohio to over $1.4 billion. Amgen Ohio had its grand opening in February 2024. At nearly 300,000 square feet, the facility is designed to meet the growing demand for Amgen medications in the U.S. With these investments across the U.S., Amgen is focused on building cutting-edge biologics manufacturing capabilities.||For the first quarter of 2025, Amgen’s total revenues increased 9% to $8.1 billion in comparison to the first quarter of 2024. Product sales grew 11%, with fifteen products delivering at least double-digit sales growth, including Repatha, Blincyto, Tezspire, Evenity, Tavneos and Uplizna. The launch of IMDELLTRA generated $81 million of sales in the quarter.||Looking to the future, the company expects total revenues in the range of $34.3 billion to $35.7 billion for the full year 2025.||“Demand for our products was strong globally in the first quarter. Ongoing new product launches and successful Phase 3 trial results for several products make us feel confident in our long-term growth prospects,” said Robert A.

In March, Amgen and AstraZeneca shared full results from the Phase 3 registrational WAYPOINT trial demonstrating that TEZSPIRE (tezepelumab-ekko) significantly reduced nasal polyp severity, the need for surgery and systemic corticosteroid use in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps compared to placebo. Most recently, the FDA approved UPLIZNA as the first and only treatment for adults with Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD), a chronic and debilitating immune-mediated inflammatory condition that can affect multiple organs. The approval of UPLIZNA for IgG4-RD is supported by data from the MITIGATE trial, the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in IgG4-RD. This trial demonstrated the potential of UPLIZNA to decrease disease activity by reducing flares in patients, while maintaining its efficacy and established safety profile. Facility Investments Amgen continued to invest in growing its manufacturing network with two major expansions in the past year. In December, the company announced a $1 billion expansion to establish a second drug substance manufacturing facility in North Carolina. This brings the company’s total planned investment in Holly Springs to more than $1.5 billion, building on its previously announced $550 million commitment. The facility will incorporate innovative manufacturing technologies. In tandem with the existing facility, these investments will create 370 new jobs in the region, supporting a robust biomanufacturing hub. This expansion enhances the company’s global biomanufacturing network, operational expertise and technological advancements to ensure the reliable and efficient delivery of high-quality medicines. Amgen also announced a $900 million expansion of its Ohio manufacturing facility, bringing the total number of jobs created to 750 and the total investment in Central Ohio to over $1.4 billion. Amgen Ohio had its grand opening in February 2024. At nearly 300,000 square feet, the facility is designed to meet the growing demand for Amgen medications in the U.S. With these investments across the U.S., Amgen is focused on building cutting-edge biologics manufacturing capabilities. Looking Forward For the first quarter of 2025, Amgen’s total revenues increased 9% to $8.1 billion in comparison to the first quarter of 2024. Product sales grew 11%, with fifteen products delivering at least double-digit sales growth, including Repatha, Blincyto, Tezspire, Evenity, Tavneos and Uplizna. The launch of IMDELLTRA generated $81 million of sales in the quarter. Looking to the future, the company expects total revenues in the range of $34.3 billion to $35.7 billion for the full year 2025. “Demand for our products was strong globally in the first quarter. Ongoing new product launches and successful Phase 3 trial results for several products make us feel confident in our long-term growth prospects,” said Robert A. Bradway, chairman and chief executive officer.

Product sales grew 19%, partially offset by 2% lower net selling price. The company’s portfolio boasts approximately 40 products spanning four therapeutic areas: General Medicine, Rare Disease, Inflammation, and Oncology. Amgen exited 2024 with 14 blockbuster products, defined as those with an annualized run rate of over $1 billion in sales. Furthermore, the company saw record sales across 21 products, with ten delivering at least double-digit sales growth, including Repatha, Tezspire, Evenity, Blincyto, and Tavneos. However, acquisition-related expenses and incremental operating expenses from Horizon impacted earnings for the year. In 2024, Amgen invested a record $6 billion in R&D, up 25% compared to the prior year, and it has numerous potential first- or best-in-class medicines moving through its pipeline to treat obesity and obesity-related conditions, cancer, heart disease, and other serious illnesses. Additionally, the company continues to invest in growing its manufacturing network to keep pace with demand for its products. In line with the company’s efforts to continue to distill complex disease biology into clarified targets, in November 2024, the company welcomed Howard Chang, M.D., Ph.D., as senior vice president of Research and chief scientific officer. Chang is responsible for establishing and leading all research priorities within Amgen’s rare disease, oncology, inflammation, and cardiometabolic therapeutic areas. He also oversees operations in key research hubs from San Francisco to Thousand Oaks, and across the company’s global network of specialized sites in Reykjavik, Copenhagen, Munich, British Columbia, and Maryland. R&D Efforts In positive pipeline news, last year, the U.S. FDA approved IMDELLTRA (tarlatamab-dlle) for the treatment of adult patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. IMDELLTRA received accelerated approval based on the encouraging response rate and duration of response (DoR) observed in clinical studies. Since then, IMDELLTRA was named as one of Time magazine’s Best Inventions of 2024 and has been rapidly adopted for patients facing SCLC. The FDA also approved BLINCYTO (blinatumomab) for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients one month or older with CD19-positive Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in the consolidation phase, regardless of measurable residual disease (MRD) status. The approval marks the third indication for BLINCYTO and is based primarily on the Phase 3 E1910 clinical trial that studied patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-negative B-ALL receiving postinduction consolidation treatment, which aims to deepen remission to achieve durable responses. Study results demonstrated that BLINCYTO added to multiphase consolidation chemotherapy showed superior overall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy alone. In January 2025, the FDA approved LUMAKRAS (sotorasib) in combination with Vectibix (panitumumab) for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received prior fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Approval is based on the pivotal Phase 3 CodeBreaK 300 study, which demonstrated that LUMAKRAS plus Vectibix is the first and only targeted treatment combination for chemorefractory KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC to show superior progression-free survival (PFS) compared to the investigated standard-of-care (SOC).

The company has been expanding its presence in China with new R&D centers and partnerships, all while facing ongoing investigations and penalties related to drug import practices there. Oncology, AstraZeneca’s largest sales portfolio, increased 21% to $22.4 billion, driven by Tagrisso, Imfinzi, Calquence, Lynparza and Enhertu. Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism grew 18% to $12.5 billion, driven by top seller Farxiga with $7.7 billion in sales. Respiratory & Immunology sales grew 23% to $7.9 billion with significant growth for Symbicort, Fasenra, Breztri, and Tezspire and Saphnelo. Rare Disease sales (legacy Alexion products) grew by 13% to $8.8 billion, driven by Ultomiris, up 32% to $3.9 billion, as well as Strensiq and Koselugo. Meanwhile, Vaccines & Immune Therapies were up 8% to $1.5 billion, driven by RSV drug Beyfortus, with recorded sales of $722 million for the year. Beyfortus (nirsevimab), approved by the FDA in July 2023, is a single dose long-acting antibody, developed and commercialized in partnership with Sanofi using AstraZeneca’s YTE technology. It’s designed help prevent lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in infants and children up to 24 months, without requiring activation of the immune system. Investments AZ has made several significant investments over the course of the year. Most recently, with a $2.5 billion investment in Beijing to establish its sixth global strategic R&D center together with major research and manufacturing agreements in China. This investment is part of a strategic partnership with the Beijing Municipal Government and Economic Development Administration and includes agreements with three biotechs: Harbour BioMed, Syneron Bio, and BioKangtai. The Beijing R&D center is AstraZeneca’s second in China following the opening of the Shanghai R&D center and will work to advance early-stage research and clinical development enabled by a new AI and data science lab. Meanwhile, two collaboration and licensing agreements with Harbour BioMed aim to discover multi-specific antibodies, and with Syneron Bio to develop macro-cyclic peptides. AstraZeneca is also launching a new joint venture with BioKangtai, to develop, manufacture, and commercialize vaccines for respiratory and other infectious diseases in China and globally. This will be AstraZeneca’s first vaccine manufacturing facility in China, located in the Beijing BioPark. In January, AstraZeneca announced an investment of $570 million in Canada across all areas of its business. The investment will support the move to a larger, state-of-the-art office facility in the Greater Toronto Area. Since 2023 the Company’s investments in Canada now exceed $1.3 billion (Canadian). Previously, AstraZeneca announced a $3.5 billion investment in the U.S. focused on expanding the company’s research and manufacturing footprint by the end of 2026. This includes a state-of-the-art R&D center in Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA; a next generation manufacturing facility for biologics in Maryland; cell therapy manufacturing capacity on the East and West Coasts; and specialty manufacturing in Texas. Finally, AstraZeneca is also building a $1.5 billion manufacturing facility in Singapore for antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), enhancing global supply of its ADC portfolio. Expected to be operationally ready by 2029, it will be AstraZeneca’s first end-to-end ADC production site, fully incorporating all steps of the manufacturing process at a commercial scale. Acquisitions & Assets In a handful of strategic acquisitions, AstraZeneca adds an immunotherapy platform targeting cancer, next generation radioconjugates, and expands its rare diseases portfolio in endocrine disorders. This past May, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of EsoBiotec for a total consideration of up to $1 billion. EsoBiotec’s in vivo cell therapies have demonstrated promising early clinical activity with its Engineered NanoBody Lentiviral (ENaBL) platform designed to empower the immune system to attack cancers. The platform has potential to streamline access to cell therapy treatments delivered in minutes as opposed to weeks, enabling cell therapies to be administered through an IV injection and without the need for immune cell depletion. In July, AstraZeneca acquired Amolyt Pharma, focused on rare endocrine diseases, for a total consideration of up to $1.05 billion, bolstering the Alexion, AstraZeneca Rare Disease late-stage pipeline and expanding its bone metabolism franchise with the addition of eneboparatide (AZP-3601), a Phase III therapeutic peptide designed to meet key therapeutic goals for hypoparathyroidism. Meanwhile last March, AstraZeneca acquired Fusion Pharmaceuticals Inc., a company developing next generation radioconjugates (RCs), in a transaction valued at approximately $2.4 billion. The acquisition is part of AstraZeneca’s goal to deliver cancer treatments that replace traditional regimens like chemotherapy and radiotherapy with more targeted treatments. RCs have potential advantages compared to traditional radiotherapy including minimizing damage to healthy cells and enabling access to tumors not reachable through external beam radiation. The acquisition adds Fusion’s pipeline of RCs, including its most advanced program, FPI-2265, a potential new treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). FPI-2265 targets prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a protein that is highly expressed in mCRPC, and is currently in a Phase II trial. The acquisition also brings new R&D expertise, manufacturing, and supply chain capabilities in actinium-based RCs. Additionally, expanding its cardiovascular portfolio, an exclusive license agreement with CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Ltd (CSPC) aims to advance the development of an early stage, novel small molecule Lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) disruptor that has the potential to offer additional benefits for dyslipidaemia. AstraZeneca gains access to CSPC’s preclinical candidate small molecule, YS2302018, an oral Lp(a) disruptor, with the aim of developing this as a lipid-lowering therapy with potential in a range of cardiovascular disease indications.

The company delivered pharmaceutical prescription drug revenues of $56.3 billion, up from $54.3 billion in 2023, thanks to its diversified growth platform spanning immunology, neuroscience, oncology, aesthetics, and eye care. While Humira declined sharply in the U.S., its global revenue still placed it among AbbVie’s top products. The company’s strategic pivot toward next-gen immunology assets has largely succeeded, with Skyrizi and Rinvoq now firmly anchoring the portfolio. The year also marked a major leadership transition, as longtime CEO Richard Gonzalez stepped down and was succeeded by Robert A. Michael, the company’s former CFO and a three-decade veteran. AbbVie’s pharmaceutical revenue growth was driven by Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which combined for $17.6 billion in global sales, up significantly from $11.7 billion in 2023. Skyrizi has now surpassed Humira as AbbVie’s top-selling product. Neuroscience revenues approached $9 billion, and oncology climbed to $6.5 billion, driven in part by expanded indications and new product launches. Aesthetics added nearly $5.2 billion in sales. This growth helped offset continued erosion of Humira sales. Despite this, AbbVie expects to return to peak revenues within two years of the U.S. Humira loss of exclusivity (LOE)—a rare industry achievement. R&D investment rose to $12.8 billion in 2024, reflecting the company’s continued prioritization of innovation. AbbVie also closed two major acquisitions and entered into 20 new collaborations and licensing agreements throughout the year. Acquisitions & Investments In late 2023 and early 2024, AbbVie significantly expanded its presence in oncology and neuroscience with two high-profile acquisitions. The $10.1 billion acquisition of ImmunoGen added Elahere to AbbVie’s portfolio, a first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Elahere received full FDA approval in 2024, and AbbVie is leveraging ImmunoGen’s ADC platform to pursue next-generation oncology targets, including IMGN-151 (in Phase 1) and pivekimab sunirine (in Phase 2 for BPDCN). AbbVie also acquired Cerevel Therapeutics for $8.7 billion, gaining access to a broad neuroscience pipeline. This included emraclidine, a late-stage next-generation antipsychotic for schizophrenia, with potential in dementia-related psychosis. The deal significantly bolstered AbbVie’s pipeline in psychiatry and neurological disorders. Additionally, AbbVie acquired Mitokinin, a biotech developing a first-in-class PINK1 activator for Parkinson’s disease, for $110 million upfront and up to $545 million in milestones. Beyond these headline deals, AbbVie made several smaller strategic investments in 2024 to augment its internal capabilities and early-stage pipeline. These included equity stakes in innovative biotech startups focused on neuroinflammation, autoimmune disorders, and precision oncology. The company also invested in expanding its biologics R&D footprint through new lab infrastructure and digitalization initiatives across key research sites. Together, these targeted investments support AbbVie’s broader goal of pipeline diversification and platform innovation. Manufacturing & Outsourcing AbbVie continues to invest in its internal manufacturing infrastructure while also leveraging strategic outsourcing to scale production across therapeutic areas. The company expanded its ADC manufacturing capabilities following the ImmunoGen acquisition, enhancing its internal development and commercial supply network for oncology biologics. This aligns with AbbVie’s growing focus on targeted biologics and ADCs. AbbVie also maintains partnerships with a global network of CDMOs to support fill-finish operations, clinical trial material production, and emerging modalities. While it has not publicly disclosed new manufacturing site builds in 2024, it has emphasized in filings and press materials that continued investment in biologics manufacturing capacity and supply chain redundancy remains a strategic priority. In 2024, AbbVie further strengthened its strategic relationships with CDMOs to support increasing demand across its expanding pipeline, particularly in the areas of neuroscience and immunology. The company emphasized flexibility and responsiveness in its external manufacturing network to accommodate shifting production needs for complex biologics and specialty drugs. Notably, AbbVie has made investments in scalable, modular manufacturing technologies and digital quality systems in collaboration with its external partners to accelerate product release timelines. This dual approach—balancing internal capabilities with outsourced partnerships—positions the company to better manage supply risks, maintain high product quality, and respond swiftly to global regulatory requirements and regional market growth. Collaborations & Alliances AbbVie struck multiple deals in 2024 to enhance its pipeline and technology platforms. In oncology, a partnership with Immunome aims to discover up to 10 novel antibody-target pairs using Immunome’s human memory B-cell platform. AbbVie also expanded its partnership with Calibr/Scripps to progress several early-stage assets across immunology, oncology, and neuroscience. AbbVie and Umoja Biopharma announced two licensing agreements to develop in-situ generated CAR-T cell therapies using Umoja’s VivoVec platform. This includes an exclusive option on UB-VV111 for hematologic malignancies. In neuroscience and immunology, AbbVie partnered with Anima Biotech to develop mRNA biology modulators and formed a new alliance with Capsida Biotherapeutics to develop gene therapies for eye diseases, expanding on an earlier neurodegenerative disease partnership. Other notable collaborations include an expanded partnership with BigHat Biosciences to use AI/ML tools to design high-quality therapeutic antibodies and a precision medicine initiative in Abu Dhabi with the Department of Health and M42 to advance genomic-based treatment strategies in oncology. R&D & Pipeline Progress AbbVie received nine product or indication approvals in 2024. These include: Skyrizi approval for ulcerative colitis; Elahere full approval for FRα-positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer; Epkinly approval for later lines of follicular lymphoma; Vyalev (Produodopa) approval for advanced Parkinson’s disease; and new label expansions for Botox and Juvéderm in aesthetics. AbbVie also made progress across its late-stage pipeline. Key Phase III programs include: Emraclidine (Cerevel asset) for schizophrenia and dementia-related psychosis; ABBV-951 (levodopa-carbidopa prodrug infusion) for Parkinson’s disease; Telisotuzumab-vedotin (Teliso-V), an anti-c-Met ADC for non-small cell lung cancer; and Rinvoq and Skyrizi label expansions across additional autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. In total, AbbVie advanced nearly 90 active clinical and device programs across therapeutic areas, with a strong emphasis on immunology, oncology, and neuroscience. Outlook Following a transitional year marked by a CEO change and the post-Humira LOE trough, AbbVie expects mid-single-digit revenue growth and remains focused on advancing its diversified pipeline. The company’s aggressive business development and targeted innovation strategy positions it well to sustain momentum across its core therapeutic areas in the years ahead.

Box 2000 Rahway, NJ 07065 USA||We aspire to be the premier research-intensive biopharmaceutical company. We’re at the forefront of research to deliver innovative health solutions that advance the prevention and treatment of diseases in people and animals.||For more than 130 years, we’ve brought hope to humanity through the development of important medicines and vaccines. We foster a diverse and inclusive global workforce and operate responsibly every day to enable a safe, sustainable and healthy future for all people and communities.||Headcount: 75,000 Year Established: 1891 Revenues: $64,168 (+7%) Pharma Revenues: $57,400 (+7%) Net Income: $17,117 (+>100%) R&D: $17,938 (-41%)||Merck takes the number two spot, up from five, thanks in part to its global top selling cancer drug Keytruda, which continues to make headway in treating numerous cancers, gaining its 39th indication in the U.S., and achieving nearly $29.5 billion in sales in 2024. As such, Merck intends to defend its flagship having licensed LaNova Medicines’ investigational PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody, LM-299.||Additionally, an investment in U.S. production capabilities with a new biologics center of excellence, and key acquisitions underscore this past year, including the diversification of its oncology pipeline with Harpoon Therapeutics’ portfolio of T-cell engagers, and EyeBio’s retinal disease drug Restoret.||Pharmaceutical sales growth for the year was primarily driven by oncology flagship Keytruda, cardiovascular franchise sales with the successful launch of Winrevair, as well as increased alliance revenue from Reblozyl and Lynparza. However, facing generic competition and battling other Type 2 diabetes medications, such as GLP-1s, this growth was partially offset by declines for Januvia, one of the company’s top selling drugs. Lower sales of COVID-19 drug Lagevrio and Gardasil also offset growth for the year.||Meanwhile, R&D expenses were down 41% to $17.9 billion for the year, primarily due to lower charges for business development activity. R&D expenses in 2023 included charges of $11.4 billion for the acquisitions of Prometheus Biosciences and Imago BioSciences. Additionally, earnings reflect a lower income expense for the year of $24 million, compared with $466 million in 2023, primarily due to a $572.5 million charge related to Zetia antitrust litigation settlements.||Merck recently began construction of a $1 billion, 470,000-sq.-ft., state-of-the-art biologics center of excellence in Wilmington, DE that will comprise lab, manufacturing and warehouse capabilities to support the launch and commercial production of its next-gen biologics and therapies, including potent antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). The site will also have the capability to manufacture Keytruda for U.S. patients as part of a significant investment to onshore drug production in the U.S.||Meanwhile, re-entering the eye drug space, Merck acquired EyeBio in a deal valued at $3 billion, paying $1.3 billion in cash and another $1.7 billion in potential milestone-based payments. Merck gained EyeBio’s retinal disease drug Restoret, a potential first-in-class tetravalent, tri-specific antibody that in September advanced into Phase 2b/3 development following positive results in Phase 1b/2a study in patients with diabetic macular edema and neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Additional pipeline candidates include clinical and preclinical assets for the prevention and treatment of vision loss associated with retinal vascular leakage, a risk factor for retinal diseases.||Merck also acquired Harpoon Therapeutics in 2024, further diversifying its oncology pipeline. For approximately $680 million Merck obtained a portfolio of novel T-cell engagers that employ the company’s Tri-specific T cell Activating Construct (TriTAC) platform, an engineered protein technology designed to direct a patient’s own immune cells to kill tumor cells, and ProTriTAC platform, applying a prodrug concept to its TriTAC platform to create a therapeutic T-cell engager that’s designed to remain inactive until it reaches the tumor. Harpoon’s lead candidate, HPN328, is a T-cell engager targeting delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) that’s expressed at high levels in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and neuroendocrine tumors.||To thwart potential competition for Ketruda, Merck closed an exclusive global license agreement in November with LaNova Medicines to develop, manufacture and commercialize LM-299, an investigational PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody, for $588 million upfront and as much as $2.7 billion in milestones.||LM-299 targets both programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a therapeutic approach is designed to inhibit both PD-1/PD-L1 and VEGF/VEGFR receptor signaling pathways releasing a key immune checkpoint while also inhibiting the production of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). A Phase 1 clinical trial for LM-299 is currently underway in China.||Merck also acquired investigational B-Cell Depletion Therapy, CN201, from Curon Biopharmaceutical for $700 million upfront and $600 million in potential milestones. CN201 a bispecific antibody being investigated in Phase 1 and Phase 1b/2 clinical trials for the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), respectively.||Looking to take advantage of the burgeoning GLP-1 market, Merck entered an exclusive global license agreement with Hansoh Pharma for oral GLP-1 candidate, HS-10535. Merck paid $112 million upfront and will pay as much as $1.9 billion in milestone payments. With HS-10535, an investigational preclinical oral small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist, Merck seeks to evaluate potential to provide additional cardiometabolic benefits beyond weight reduction.||Additionally, under an exclusive license agreement with Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals, Merck gained exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize HRS-5346 worldwide, excluding the Greater China region, for $200 million upfront and up to $1.77 billion in potential milestones. HRS-5346, an investigational oral small molecule Lipoprotein(a) inhibitor currently in a Phase 2 development in China.||Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda gained a third indication in cervical cancer in the U.S. in combination with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for the treatment Stage III-IVA cervical cancer. The approval is based on data from the Phase 3 Keynote-A18 trial, in which KEYTRUDA plus CRT demonstrated an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), reducing the risk of disease progression or death by an impressive 41% compared to placebo.||Keytruda is advancing in several late-stage trials. As a perioperative treatment for newly diagnosed stage III or IV, resected, locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC), the Keynote-689 trial met its primary endpoint of event-free survival (EFS). It’s the first Phase 3 trial to demonstrate statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in EFS in the intent-to-treat neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting for an anti-PD-1 therapy in earlier stages of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The FDA has granted priority review for Merck’s new supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) in this indication.||Meanwhile, in kidney cancer, Keytruda reduced the risk of death by 38% versus placebo as an adjuvant therapy for patients with Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) at an increased risk of recurrence following nephrectomy. Additionally, in bladder cancer, the drug significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) as an adjuvant therapy versus observation in high-risk patients with localized muscle-invasive and locally advanced urothelial carcinoma after surgery.||Lastly, the Phase 3 Keynote-B96 trial also recently met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) for the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer whose tumors expressed PD-L1 and in all comers. The study also met a secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS) in patients whose tumors express PD-L1.||Contract Pharma is the premier media outlet linking contract service providers and their pharma/biopharma sponsors.||Copyright © 2025 Rodman Media.

Key Personnel NAME JOB TITLE Rob Davis chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Merck Sanat Chattopadhyay Executive vice president and president, Merck Manufacturing Division Richard R. DeLuca, Jr. Executive vice president and president, Merck Animal Health Yearly results 2025 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 Sales: 57.4 Billion Headcount: 75,000 Year Established: 1891 Revenues: $64,168 (+7%) Pharma Revenues: $57,400 (+7%) Net Income: $17,117 (+>100%) R&D: $17,938 (-41%) Merck takes the number two spot, up from five, thanks in part to its global top selling cancer drug Keytruda, which continues to make headway in treating numerous cancers, gaining its 39th indication in the U.S., and achieving nearly $29.5 billion in sales in 2024. As such, Merck intends to defend its flagship having licensed LaNova Medicines’ investigational PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody, LM-299. Additionally, an investment in U.S. production capabilities with a new biologics center of excellence, and key acquisitions underscore this past year, including the diversification of its oncology pipeline with Harpoon Therapeutics’ portfolio of T-cell engagers, and EyeBio’s retinal disease drug Restoret. Pharmaceutical sales growth for the year was primarily driven by oncology flagship Keytruda, cardiovascular franchise sales with the successful launch of Winrevair, as well as increased alliance revenue from Reblozyl and Lynparza. However, facing generic competition and battling other Type 2 diabetes medications, such as GLP-1s, this growth was partially offset by declines for Januvia, one of the company’s top selling drugs. Lower sales of COVID-19 drug Lagevrio and Gardasil also offset growth for the year. Meanwhile, R&D expenses were down 41% to $17.9 billion for the year, primarily due to lower charges for business development activity. R&D expenses in 2023 included charges of $11.4 billion for the acquisitions of Prometheus Biosciences and Imago BioSciences. Additionally, earnings reflect a lower income expense for the year of $24 million, compared with $466 million in 2023, primarily due to a $572.5 million charge related to Zetia antitrust litigation settlements. U.S. Investment & Acquisitions Merck recently began construction of a $1 billion, 470,000-sq.-ft., state-of-the-art biologics center of excellence in Wilmington, DE that will comprise lab, manufacturing and warehouse capabilities to support the launch and commercial production of its next-gen biologics and therapies, including potent antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). The site will also have the capability to manufacture Keytruda for U.S. patients as part of a significant investment to onshore drug production in the U.S. Meanwhile, re-entering the eye drug space, Merck acquired EyeBio in a deal valued at $3 billion, paying $1.3 billion in cash and another $1.7 billion in potential milestone-based payments. Merck gained EyeBio’s retinal disease drug Restoret, a potential first-in-class tetravalent, tri-specific antibody that in September advanced into Phase 2b/3 development following positive results in Phase 1b/2a study in patients with diabetic macular edema and neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Additional pipeline candidates include clinical and preclinical assets for the prevention and treatment of vision loss associated with retinal vascular leakage, a risk factor for retinal diseases. Merck also acquired Harpoon Therapeutics in 2024, further diversifying its oncology pipeline. For approximately $680 million Merck obtained a portfolio of novel T-cell engagers that employ the company’s Tri-specific T cell Activating Construct (TriTAC) platform, an engineered protein technology designed to direct a patient’s own immune cells to kill tumor cells, and ProTriTAC platform, applying a prodrug concept to its TriTAC platform to create a therapeutic T-cell engager that’s designed to remain inactive until it reaches the tumor. Harpoon’s lead candidate, HPN328, is a T-cell engager targeting delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) that’s expressed at high levels in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and neuroendocrine tumors. Asset Agreements To thwart potential competition for Ketruda, Merck closed an exclusive global license agreement in November with LaNova Medicines to develop, manufacture and commercialize LM-299, an investigational PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody, for $588 million upfront and as much as $2.7 billion in milestones. LM-299 targets both programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a therapeutic approach is designed to inhibit both PD-1/PD-L1 and VEGF/VEGFR receptor signaling pathways releasing a key immune checkpoint while also inhibiting the production of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). A Phase 1 clinical trial for LM-299 is currently underway in China. Merck also acquired investigational B-Cell Depletion Therapy, CN201, from Curon Biopharmaceutical for $700 million upfront and $600 million in potential milestones. CN201 a bispecific antibody being investigated in Phase 1 and Phase 1b/2 clinical trials for the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), respectively. Looking to take advantage of the burgeoning GLP-1 market, Merck entered an exclusive global license agreement with Hansoh Pharma for oral GLP-1 candidate, HS-10535. Merck paid $112 million upfront and will pay as much as $1.9 billion in milestone payments. With HS-10535, an investigational preclinical oral small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist, Merck seeks to evaluate potential to provide additional cardiometabolic benefits beyond weight reduction. Additionally, under an exclusive license agreement with Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals, Merck gained exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize HRS-5346 worldwide, excluding the Greater China region, for $200 million upfront and up to $1.77 billion in potential milestones. HRS-5346, an investigational oral small molecule Lipoprotein(a) inhibitor currently in a Phase 2 development in China. R&D Highlights Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda gained a third indication in cervical cancer in the U.S. in combination with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for the treatment Stage III-IVA cervical cancer. The approval is based on data from the Phase 3 Keynote-A18 trial, in which KEYTRUDA plus CRT demonstrated an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), reducing the risk of disease progression or death by an impressive 41% compared to placebo. Keytruda is advancing in several late-stage trials. As a perioperative treatment for newly diagnosed stage III or IV, resected, locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LA-HNSCC), the Keynote-689 trial met its primary endpoint of event-free survival (EFS). It’s the first Phase 3 trial to demonstrate statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in EFS in the intent-to-treat neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting for an anti-PD-1 therapy in earlier stages of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The FDA has granted priority review for Merck’s new supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) in this indication. Meanwhile, in kidney cancer, Keytruda reduced the risk of death by 38% versus placebo as an adjuvant therapy for patients with Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) at an increased risk of recurrence following nephrectomy. Additionally, in bladder cancer, the drug significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) as an adjuvant therapy versus observation in high-risk patients with localized muscle-invasive and locally advanced urothelial carcinoma after surgery. Lastly, the Phase 3 Keynote-B96 trial also recently met its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) for the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer whose tumors expressed PD-L1 and in all comers. The study also met a secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS) in patients whose tumors express PD-L1.

Beyfortus, developed in partnership with AstraZeneca, will face competition from Merck’s recently approved Enflonsia, a similar RSV treatment. Additionally, new launches contributed 11% of sales driven by ALTUVIIIO in hemophilia A, Nexviazyme in Pompe disease, Rezurock in chronic graft-versus-host disease, and Sarclisa in multiple myeloma, among others.||Business ventures this past year include several key acquisitions and investments in both infrastructure and R&D assets. Joining the likes of Roche, Lilly, J&J, Novartis, BMS, and others, Sanofi increased its investments in the U.S. to at least $20 billion through 2030 to boost manufacturing and research. Sanofi plans to enhance its manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. by investing directly in its Sanofi facilities and collaborating with other local manufacturers. Sanofi also plans to invest a significant portion of the funds to boost research and development efforts in the U.S.||Several acquisitions and licensing agreements add assets in core areas of immunology, neurodegenerative, autoimmune, and rare diseases. In a transaction valued at approximately $9.5 billion, Sanofi will acquire Blueprint Medicines Corp., a U.S.-based biopharma company specializing in systemic mastocytosis (SM), a rare immunological disease, and other KIT-driven diseases. The acquisition includes a rare immunology disease medicine, Ayvakit/Ayvakyt (avapritinib), approved in the U.S. and the EU, and a promising advanced and early-stage immunology pipeline.||Ayvakit/Ayvakyt is the only approved medicine for advanced and indolent systemic mastocytosis (ASM & ISM), which is characterized by the accumulation and activation of aberrant mast cells in bone marrow, skin, the gastrointestinal tract, and other organs.

Beyfortus, developed in partnership with AstraZeneca, will face competition from Merck’s recently approved Enflonsia, a similar RSV treatment. Additionally, new launches contributed 11% of sales driven by ALTUVIIIO in hemophilia A, Nexviazyme in Pompe disease, Rezurock in chronic graft-versus-host disease, and Sarclisa in multiple myeloma, among others. Business ventures this past year include several key acquisitions and investments in both infrastructure and R&D assets. Joining the likes of Roche, Lilly, J&J, Novartis, BMS, and others, Sanofi increased its investments in the U.S. to at least $20 billion through 2030 to boost manufacturing and research. Sanofi plans to enhance its manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. by investing directly in its Sanofi facilities and collaborating with other local manufacturers. Sanofi also plans to invest a significant portion of the funds to boost research and development efforts in the U.S. Assets & Acquisitions Several acquisitions and licensing agreements add assets in core areas of immunology, neurodegenerative, autoimmune, and rare diseases. In a transaction valued at approximately $9.5 billion, Sanofi will acquire Blueprint Medicines Corp., a U.S.-based biopharma company specializing in systemic mastocytosis (SM), a rare immunological disease, and other KIT-driven diseases. The acquisition includes a rare immunology disease medicine, Ayvakit/Ayvakyt (avapritinib), approved in the U.S. and the EU, and a promising advanced and early-stage immunology pipeline. Ayvakit/Ayvakyt is the only approved medicine for advanced and indolent systemic mastocytosis (ASM & ISM), which is characterized by the accumulation and activation of aberrant mast cells in bone marrow, skin, the gastrointestinal tract, and other organs. The acquisition will also bring elenestinib, a next-gen medicine for SM, as well as BLU-808, a highly selective and potent oral wild-type KIT inhibitor that has the potential to treat a broad range of diseases in immunology. This past May, Sanofi entered an agreement to acquire Vigil Neuroscience Inc., a company focused on developing therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, for approximately $470 million. As one of Sanofi’s four strategic disease areas, the acquisition enhances its early-stage pipeline and includes VG-3927, which will be evaluated in a phase 2 clinical study in Alzheimer’s disease.  Sanofi licensed AI-discovered biologics from Earendil Labs, gaining exclusive worldwide rights to two bispecific antibodies, HXN-1002 and HXN-1003, both utilizing Earendil Labs’ AI and high-throughput discovery and research platform. As part of the agreement Sanofi paid $125 million upfront and Earendil Labs is eligible to receive up to a total of $1.72 billion in development and commercial milestones. Additionally, for $600 million upfront Sanofi acquired DR-0201, a targeted bispecific myeloid cell engager (MCE) that has shown robust B-cell depletion in early clinical studies, from Dren Bio Inc. DR-0201 is a potential first-in-class CD20-directed bispecific antibody that targets and engages specific tissue-resident and trafficking myeloid cells to induce B-cell depletion via targeted phagocytosis. Recent early study data in autoimmune diseases suggest that deep B-cell depletion might have the potential to reset the adaptive immune system, leading to sustained treatment-free remission in patients with refractory B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases such as lupus. Lastly, a collaboration and license agreement with Fulcrum Therapeutics aims to develop and commercialize losmapimod, an oral small molecule being investigated for the treatment of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a chronic and progressive genetic muscular disorder. Under the license agreement, Sanofi obtains exclusive commercialization rights for losmapimod outside of the U.S. The collaboration combines Fulcrum’s expertise in FSHD with Sanofi’s global reach and experience with rare diseases. Results from the Phase 2 trial ReDUX4, demonstrated a slowing of disease progression and improved muscle health. Alliances Meanwhile several key alliances aim to advance efforts in vaccines and oncology, as well as bioprocessing capabilities. A strategic partnership with Orano Med aims to accelerate the development of next generation radioligand therapies (RLTs) for rare cancers. The collaboration will leverage the expertise and pipeline of Orano Med, a pioneer in targeted alpha therapies, to create a new entity focused on the discovery, design, and clinical development of lead-212 based RLTs. Targeted alpha therapy is a promising approach that combines the precision of biological vectors with the potent cell-killing power of alpha-emitting radioisotopes. By targeting cancer cells specifically, this therapy aims to minimize damage to healthy tissues, offering hope for patients with difficult-to-treat cancers. An expanded alliance with SK bioscience in pneumococcal vaccines aims to develop, license and commercialize next-generation PCVs for pediatric and adult populations. The $52 million expansion builds on the companies’ existing collaboration to develop and commercialize a PCV21 pediatric vaccine, which recently entered Phase 3 development. This vaccine candidate is the first PCV containing more than 20 serotypes to enter a phase 3 trial in infants and toddlers. Meanwhile, a collaboration with Sartorius aims to develop an end-to-end platform for integrated and continuous downstream bioprocessing (ICB), an advanced approach to the production of biopharmaceuticals that aims to maximize efficiency by enabling uninterrupted and steady materials flow, as opposed to traditional batch methods, and by integrating multiple unit operations into a lean process setup. ICB aims to reduce the overall process footprint, leading to lower raw material and energy consumption, higher productivity, and less waste. Key Approvals This past June Dupixent picked up approval in the U.S. as the only targeted medicine to treat patients with bullous pemphigoid. The approval based on results showing improvements in sustained disease remission and reductions in itch and oral corticosteroid use compared to placebo in adults with BP, a chronic, debilitating, and relapsing rare skin disease. Dupixent is now approved to treat eight distinct diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation, including diseases of the skin, gut, and respiratory system that affect a broad range of patients, from infants to elderly people. Dupixent was also approved by the FDA as the first-ever biologic medicine for patients with COPD. Dupixent is now indicated for the approximately 300,000 adults in the U.S. with inadequately controlled COPD and an eosinophilic phenotype. Following recent approvals in the EU and China, the U.S. approval is based on two phase 3 studies that showed Dupixent achieved significant reduction in exacerbations and showed improvements in lung function and health-related quality of life compared to placebo. Additionally, Sarclisa gained approval in the U.S. as the first anti-CD38 therapy in combination with standard-of-care treatment for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma not eligible for transplant. The approval was based on positive results from the IMROZ Phase 3 study demonstrating Sarclisa in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS), compared to standard-of-care. This third indication for Sarclisa was evaluated under FDA Priority Review.

With these investments, Novartis will have manufacturing capacity in the U.S. for all its core technology platforms, including small molecules and biologics and will be able to produce 100% of its key medicines end-to-end in the U.S., a significant increase from current levels. This investment will also bring internal manufacturing of the company’s siRNA technology to the U.S. for the first time and reflects a commitment to increase U.S. manufacturing across its main therapeutic areas: oncology, immunology, neuroscience, and cardiovascular, renal and metabolic. Acquisitions This significant investment in infrastructure also supports recent acquisitions in the U.S. For a total consideration of as much as approximately $1.7 billion, Novartis is acquiring Regulus Therapeutics, a San Diego-based, biopharma company focused on developing microRNA therapeutics. Regulus’ lead asset, farabursen, is a potential first-in-class oligonucleotide targeting miR-17 for the treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Farabursen is designed to target miR-17 with preferential kidney exposure, aiming to reduce the growth of cysts and kidney size, as well as delay progression of disease severity. For $925 million upfront, and potential additional payments of up to $2.15 billion in regulatory and sales milestones, Novartis entered an agreement to acquire Anthos Therapeutics, Inc., a Boston-based, biopharma company that will add abelacimab, a late-stage medicine in development for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. Anthos Therapeutics, launched by Blackstone Life Sciences and Novartis in 2019, has advanced abelacimab through clinical development under a license from Novartis. Abelacimab is a highly selective, fully human monoclonal antibody designed to induce effective hemostasis-sparing anticoagulation through Factor XI inhibition. Abelacimab received a Fast Track Designation from the FDA for the treatment of thrombosis associated with cancer, and for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. Additionally, Novartis has acquired Kate Therapeutics, a San Diego-based, biotechnology company developing adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapies to treat neuromuscular diseases, in a transaction valued at $1.1 billion. Kate Therapeutics’ primary programs include preclinical candidates for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Kate Therapeutics’ technology platforms aim to improve both the efficacy and safety of gene therapies, opening the potential to treat complex diseases previously difficult to address, including inherited neuromuscular diseases. Furthermore, in May of last year, Novartis entered an agreement to acquire Mariana Oncology, based in Watertown, MA, for $1 billion upfront and an additional $750 million in milestone payments. The acquisition includes a portfolio of radioligand therapies (RLTs) spanning lead optimization to early development across a range of solid tumor indications such as breast, prostate and lung cancer, including development candidate MC-339, an actinium-based RLT being investigated in small cell lung cancer. RLTs are a form of precision medicine that enables the delivery of radiation to the tumor, while limiting damage to the surrounding cells. With the successful closing of the acquisition of MorphoSys AG in May 2024, following a voluntary public takeover offer for €2.7 billion, Novartis expanded its oncology pipeline as well as its global footprint in hematology with the Germany-based, global biopharma. Novartis gained pelabresib, a novel treatment option with a well-tolerated safety profile provided in combination with ruxolitinib for patients with myelofibrosis (MF). It also includes tulmimetostat, an early-stage dual inhibitor of enhancer of zeste homolog 1 and 2 (EZH1 and EZH2) proteins currently being tested in solid tumors and lymphomas. Pelabresib in combination with ruxolitinib recently met its primary endpoint of spleen volume reduction in a Phase 3 study in JAK inhibitor-naive MF patients. The combination also demonstrated favorable trends in symptom improvement. Pelabresib is also being studied in essential thrombocythemia (ET). MorphoSys’ pipeline also includes a partnered assets of which some are in partnership with Novartis, including ianalumab (VAY736) which is studied across multiple immunological diseases and in hematology. Licensing Deals & Alliances Novartis paid $1 billion upfront, and potential $1.9 billion in milestones, for an exclusive global license and collaboration agreement with PTC Therapeutics that aims to advance PTC’s Huntington’s disease program, including PTC518 and related molecules. Interim results from a Phase 2 PIVOT-HD trial indicate that treatment with PTC518 led to a sustained, dose-dependent decrease in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the mutant Huntingtin protein (HTT), along with initial indications of a dose-dependent advantage in key clinical metrics after 12 months. Novartis will assume responsibility for PTC518’s development, manufacturing and commercialization, following the completion of the on-going placebo-controlled portion of PIVOT-HD, which is expected to occur in 1H25. Additionally, an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Ratio Therapeutics aims to develop a Somatostatin Receptor 2 (SSTR2) radiotherapeutic candidate for cancer. Under this agreement, Ratio will receive combined upfront and potential milestone payments of up to $745 million. The companies will work to drive preclinical activities and select an SSTR2-targeting development candidate. After which, Novartis will assume responsibility for all remaining development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities. Another exclusive global development and commercialization license agreement with Monte Rosa Therapeutics, aims to advance VAV1 MGDs, including MRT-6160, which is currently in Phase 1 development in for immune-mediated conditions. Novartis paid $150 million upfront and Monte Rosa is eligible to receive up to $2.1 billion in milestones.

That work inspires some of the most interesting, meaningful, and life-changing careers you’ll experience. Join us and pursue innovative ideas alongside some of the brightest minds in biopharma, collaborating with a team rich in diversity of experiences, and perspectives. We have built a sustainable pipeline of potential therapies and are leveraging translational medicine and data analytics to understand how we can deliver the right medicine to the right patient, at the right time, to achieve the best outcome.||Headcount: 34,100 Year Established: 1891 Revenues: $48,300 (+7%) Net Loss: $8,933 (+>100%) R&D: $11,159 (+20%)||Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) navigated 2024 with a transformative strategy aimed at reinvigorating its pipeline, scaling cell therapy capabilities, and offsetting revenue headwinds from loss of exclusivity on key drugs. The company achieved strong momentum with regulatory approvals, business development activity, and a push for operational efficiency amid macroeconomic challenges.||BMS reported 2024 total revenues of $48.3 billion, a 7% year-over-year increase. The increase was driven by double-digit growth in the company’s “New Product Portfolio,” which generated $3.6 billion in sales—up 77% from 2023. Key contributors included Opdualag, Reblozyl, Camzyos, Breyanzi, Zeposia, and Sotyktu. However, sales of Revlimid continued to decline due to generic erosion. Eliquis remained BMS’ top-selling product, despite increasing competitive pressure, and Opdivo revenues grew, helped by the rollout of Opdivo Qvantig, the first subcutaneous PD-1 inhibitor.||To counter patent cliffs and maintain financial agility, BMS pursued cost containment initiatives targeting $1.5 billion in savings by the end of 2025. In 2024, the company realized most of those savings and committed to an expanded goal of $2 billion in reductions by 2027, with much of the savings reinvested into high-growth pipeline programs.||BMS accelerated its diversification strategy through a trio of high-profile acquisitions. Karuna Therapeutics brought a novel schizophrenia therapy (KarXT) into BMS’ pipeline. The NDA for KarXT was accepted by the FDA with a PDUFA date of September 26, 2024. RayzeBio added actinium-based radiopharmaceuticals and enhanced radiopharma manufacturing infrastructure. Mirati Therapeutics expanded the oncology portfolio with Krazati for KRASG12C-mutated cancers and introduced early-stage clinical candidates including a PRMT5 inhibitor.||These acquisitions not only bolstered BMS’s R&D engine but also added strategic commercial and manufacturing infrastructure. RayzeBio’s assets provide a launchpad for future radiotherapeutics, while Mirati’s targeted oncology pipeline enhances BMS’s ability to compete in high-growth molecular segments. The integration of Karuna represents BMS’s expanded investment in neuroscience, a therapeutic area historically underserved in pharma pipelines. As KarXT advances through regulatory review, BMS has the potential to become a leader in next-generation psychiatric treatments.||In addition to M&A, BMS forged a key partnership with SystImmune for the global development of BL-B01D1, a first-in-class EGFRxHER3 bispecific ADC in Phase 1 for metastatic or unresectable non-small cell lung cancer.||BMS also made significant internal capital investments to support its long-term strategic plan. These included enhancing digital capabilities to support global development and the continued expansion of data-driven R&D, especially in early discovery and translational science.||BMS expanded its cell therapy manufacturing capabilities through two major efforts. First, a worldwide capacity agreement was inked with Cellares, an integrated development and manufacturing organization (IDMO), to automate and scale manufacturing of CAR T cell therapies using the Cell Shuttle platform. This includes deployment across Smart Factories in the U.S., EU, and Japan.||Through its deal with Cellares, BMS has signaled a broader commitment to flexible, automated manufacturing platforms that enable global scalability and faster turnaround times. The Cell Shuttle system, paired with the Cell Q quality control system, represents an industry-first approach to high-throughput CAR T production with reduced manual intervention. The agreement ensures long-term access to capacity across regions, helping BMS manage supply-demand fluctuations while meeting rigorous regulatory and quality standards.||The second highlight was FDA’s approval of commercial production at BMS’ newest 244,000 sq.-ft. Devens, MA facility, which strengthens the company’s long-term global supply of cell therapies.||The Devens facility expansion is the second major manufacturing buildout at the site and reflects BMS’s multi-year commitment to scaling cell therapy production. The facility plays a central role in supplying Breyanzi and Abecma—two of the company’s leading CAR T therapies—as demand increases with label expansions and earlier-line treatment approvals. The site is designed to enable both clinical and commercial production with integrated digital and automation infrastructure, a key differentiator in BMS’s competitive cell therapy network.||BMS’s broader manufacturing strategy also includes modernizing conventional biologics production and improving tech-transfer timelines through enhanced digital analytics and AI-based modeling. The company is increasingly relying on external CDMO partnerships for development-stage manufacturing to maintain agility and focus internal resources on high-complexity commercial pro-duction. This hybrid approach reflects an evolving outsourcing model, with BMS prioritizing strategic flexibility, regional redundancy, and rapid scale-up capability in support of its diversified portfolio.||BMS secured 19 approvals from the FDA and other global regulatory bodies in 2024. Notable highlights include FDA’s accelerated approval of Augtyro for NTRK-positive solid tumors. Data from the TRIDENT-1 trial showed a 58% ORR in TKI-naïve patients, with 83% maintaining response at one year.||Multiple approvals were achieved with Breyanzi, including for re-lapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In MCL, Breyanzi achieved an 85% response rate with a consistent safety profile.||Lastly, Abecma reported expanded label for earlier-line treatment of re-lapsed/refractory multiple myeloma based on Phase 3 KarMMa-3 data showing tripled PFS and 51% reduced risk of progression or death.||BMS reported over 55 compounds in development across more than 40 disease areas. Highlights from the Phase III pipeline and advanced programs include a new mechanism antipsychotic for Cobenfy (formerly KarXT) for schizophrenia, with expansion plans into Alzheimer’s-related indications.||Pivotal data is expected for Reblozyl for line extensions in MDS and myelofibrosis-related anemia; Label expansion potential for Opdivo in hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, and NSCLC, including a subcutaneous version; Cell therapy advancements in multiple myeloma and lymphomas with Abecma and Breyanzi; and radiopharma and ADC programs acquired via RayzeBio and SystImmune are expected to yield registrational data starting in 2025.||Beyond SystImmune and Cellares, BMS maintained development partnerships across key programs. It expanded its reach into the China oncology market through its strategic collaboration with Zai Lab, advancing Cobenfy and Krazati for solid tumors.||BMS and Merck continued co-commercialization of Reblozyl, focusing on its potential to treat anemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and beta thalassemia.||The company’s alliance with Prothena supports early-stage research into BMS-986495, a novel treatment for Alzheimer’s and related neurodegenerative diseases.||Leveraging AI-driven drug discovery, BMS and Exscientia advanced a PKCθ inhibitor program aimed at autoimmune diseases.||Lastly, the partnership with 2seventy bio progressed the commercialization and lifecycle expansion of Abecma, a CAR-T therapy for multiple myeloma.||With $11.2 billion invested in R&D and several milestone-rich catalysts ahead, BMS is positioning itself for renewed momentum as it reshapes its portfolio around next-gen immunology, oncology, neuroscience, and cardiovascular treatments. As legacy products like Revlimid continue to decline, the company’s emphasis on pipeline execution, business development, and manufacturing innovation underscores its ambition to emerge as one of the fastest-growing pharma companies by the end of the decade.||Contract Pharma is the premier media outlet linking contract service providers and their pharma/biopharma sponsors.||Copyright © 2025 Rodman Media.

In 2024, the company realized most of those savings and committed to an expanded goal of $2 billion in reductions by 2027, with much of the savings reinvested into high-growth pipeline programs. Acquisitions & Investments BMS accelerated its diversification strategy through a trio of high-profile acquisitions. Karuna Therapeutics brought a novel schizophrenia therapy (KarXT) into BMS’ pipeline. The NDA for KarXT was accepted by the FDA with a PDUFA date of September 26, 2024. RayzeBio added actinium-based radiopharmaceuticals and enhanced radiopharma manufacturing infrastructure. Mirati Therapeutics expanded the oncology portfolio with Krazati for KRASG12C-mutated cancers and introduced early-stage clinical candidates including a PRMT5 inhibitor. These acquisitions not only bolstered BMS’s R&D engine but also added strategic commercial and manufacturing infrastructure. RayzeBio’s assets provide a launchpad for future radiotherapeutics, while Mirati’s targeted oncology pipeline enhances BMS’s ability to compete in high-growth molecular segments. The integration of Karuna represents BMS’s expanded investment in neuroscience, a therapeutic area historically underserved in pharma pipelines. As KarXT advances through regulatory review, BMS has the potential to become a leader in next-generation psychiatric treatments. In addition to M&A, BMS forged a key partnership with SystImmune for the global development of BL-B01D1, a first-in-class EGFRxHER3 bispecific ADC in Phase 1 for metastatic or unresectable non-small cell lung cancer. BMS also made significant internal capital investments to support its long-term strategic plan. These included enhancing digital capabilities to support global development and the continued expansion of data-driven R&D, especially in early discovery and translational science. Manufacturing & Outsourcing BMS expanded its cell therapy manufacturing capabilities through two major efforts. First, a worldwide capacity agreement was inked with Cellares, an integrated development and manufacturing organization (IDMO), to automate and scale manufacturing of CAR T cell therapies using the Cell Shuttle platform. This includes deployment across Smart Factories in the U.S., EU, and Japan. Through its deal with Cellares, BMS has signaled a broader commitment to flexible, automated manufacturing platforms that enable global scalability and faster turnaround times. The Cell Shuttle system, paired with the Cell Q quality control system, represents an industry-first approach to high-throughput CAR T production with reduced manual intervention. The agreement ensures long-term access to capacity across regions, helping BMS manage supply-demand fluctuations while meeting rigorous regulatory and quality standards. The second highlight was FDA’s approval of commercial production at BMS’ newest 244,000 sq.-ft. Devens, MA facility, which strengthens the company’s long-term global supply of cell therapies. The Devens facility expansion is the second major manufacturing buildout at the site and reflects BMS’s multi-year commitment to scaling cell therapy production. The facility plays a central role in supplying Breyanzi and Abecma—two of the company’s leading CAR T therapies—as demand increases with label expansions and earlier-line treatment approvals. The site is designed to enable both clinical and commercial production with integrated digital and automation infrastructure, a key differentiator in BMS’s competitive cell therapy network. BMS’s broader manufacturing strategy also includes modernizing conventional biologics production and improving tech-transfer timelines through enhanced digital analytics and AI-based modeling. The company is increasingly relying on external CDMO partnerships for development-stage manufacturing to maintain agility and focus internal resources on high-complexity commercial pro-duction. This hybrid approach reflects an evolving outsourcing model, with BMS prioritizing strategic flexibility, regional redundancy, and rapid scale-up capability in support of its diversified portfolio. Regulatory Milestones & Pipeline Progress BMS secured 19 approvals from the FDA and other global regulatory bodies in 2024. Notable highlights include FDA’s accelerated approval of Augtyro for NTRK-positive solid tumors. Data from the TRIDENT-1 trial showed a 58% ORR in TKI-naïve patients, with 83% maintaining response at one year. Multiple approvals were achieved with Breyanzi, including for re-lapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In MCL, Breyanzi achieved an 85% response rate with a consistent safety profile. Lastly, Abecma reported expanded label for earlier-line treatment of re-lapsed/refractory multiple myeloma based on Phase 3 KarMMa-3 data showing tripled PFS and 51% reduced risk of progression or death. BMS reported over 55 compounds in development across more than 40 disease areas. Highlights from the Phase III pipeline and advanced programs include a new mechanism antipsychotic for Cobenfy (formerly KarXT) for schizophrenia, with expansion plans into Alzheimer’s-related indications. Pivotal data is expected for Reblozyl for line extensions in MDS and myelofibrosis-related anemia; Label expansion potential for Opdivo in hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, and NSCLC, including a subcutaneous version; Cell therapy advancements in multiple myeloma and lymphomas with Abecma and Breyanzi; and radiopharma and ADC programs acquired via RayzeBio and SystImmune are expected to yield registrational data starting in 2025. Collaborations & Alliances Beyond SystImmune and Cellares, BMS maintained development partnerships across key programs. It expanded its reach into the China oncology market through its strategic collaboration with Zai Lab, advancing Cobenfy and Krazati for solid tumors. BMS and Merck continued co-commercialization of Reblozyl, focusing on its potential to treat anemia in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and beta thalassemia. The company’s alliance with Prothena supports early-stage research into BMS-986495, a novel treatment for Alzheimer’s and related neurodegenerative diseases. Leveraging AI-driven drug discovery, BMS and Exscientia advanced a PKCθ inhibitor program aimed at autoimmune diseases. Lastly, the partnership with 2seventy bio progressed the commercialization and lifecycle expansion of Abecma, a CAR-T therapy for multiple myeloma. Outlook With $11.2 billion invested in R&D and several milestone-rich catalysts ahead, BMS is positioning itself for renewed momentum as it reshapes its portfolio around next-gen immunology, oncology, neuroscience, and cardiovascular treatments. As legacy products like Revlimid continue to decline, the company’s emphasis on pipeline execution, business development, and manufacturing innovation underscores its ambition to emerge as one of the fastest-growing pharma companies by the end of the decade.

This necessitates an integrated approach to enabled intermediates and drug product design, moving beyond traditional methods to embrace innovation and strategic thinking.||Yizheng Cao, Principal Scientist in the Process and Product Development department at Serán, shares insight on challenges in oral drug delivery, drug product design, innovative formulation strategies, selecting manufacturing technologies, and resolving solubility and permeability concerns.||Contract Pharma: What are the primary challenges in oral drug delivery that necessitate new thinking and innovative formulation strategies today?||Yizheng Cao: Drug developers are now frequently tasked with designing oral products for molecules with low solubility and low permeability, including small molecules, PROTACs, peptides, and other challenging molecules. This increasing molecular complexity, coupled with compressed clinical development timelines, demands advanceable and robust formulations right from the start of development.||Contract Pharma: How has the approach to drug product design evolved to address these complex molecules and compressed timelines?||Yizheng Cao: Effective development now requires a more comprehensive and integrated approach. This means simultaneously considering drug product design and manufacturability along with the development of enabled intermediates, rather than solely focusing on the intermediate itself. A fundamental understanding of molecular properties combined with a strategic plan for drug product design can lead to effective and advanceable formulations for even the most challenging drug products. The goal is to develop a commercially relevant, advanceable formulation as early as Phase I.||Contract Pharma: Can you provide an example of innovative formulation strategies for compounds with poor solubility, particularly when traditional methods might have limitations?||Yizheng Cao: One innovative approach is the “IR+” (immediate release plus) tablet formulation. Instead of solely relying on amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) – a common approach – the IR+ tablet formulates the crystalline API with an acidulant and a precipitation inhibitor. The acidulant creates a low pH microenvironment when the tablet disintegrates in the stomach, even if the bulk gastric pH is high, thereby improving the dissolution of the crystalline API. Simultaneously, the precipitation inhibitor helps maintain supersaturation of the dissolved API as it transfers to the intestine, leading to high exposure and enhanced robustness. This simplified formulation can reduce costs, time, and risks compared to more complex processes like ASD manufacturing.||Contract Pharma: When amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs) are necessary, what new considerations are there for selecting manufacturing technologies, and how do they impact drug product design?||Yizheng Cao: When ASDs are required, two well-established manufacturing technologies are spray drying (SDD) and hot melt extrusion (HME). While both are robust and scalable, their particle properties significantly influence downstream drug product design and performance.||The choice between SDD and HME depends on the specific molecule, program, and problem statement, as no single process is always superior; the pros and cons for process throughput, stability, particle engineering, bioperformance, and drug product design must be carefully considered.||Contract Pharma: What are the emerging challenges and innovative approaches for developing formulations that require permeation enhancement, especially for larger molecules?||Yizheng Cao: Integrated drug product design directly addresses the significant permeability challenges encountered with complex molecules, particularly larger ones like peptides and PROTACs. The core idea is to employ a comprehensive strategy that considers not just the components, but also their processing, manufacturability, and targeted delivery. Key strategies for overcoming permeability challenges include:||o   Spray Drying with Dry Granulation: This process begins by spray drying a dispersion of the API and enhancer, ensuring intimate mixing at a molecular level. Subsequently, a dry granulation step densifies the resulting powders, which often have poor flowability, and allows for the optional addition of more permeation enhancers.||o   Wet Granulation: An alternative is to introduce peptides and enhancers as a solution into a wet granulation process. This ensures high uniformity and composition of the elements and produces a blend with excellent flowability, achieving both intimate mixing and improved powder properties in a single step. These methods help engineer powder properties to maximize drug loading.||o   Enteric Coating: To achieve this synchronized and targeted delivery, enteric coating is often applied to drug products (capsules or tablets). This pH-triggered coating prevents drug release in the acidic stomach and allows for a rapid and simultaneous release of both the API and the permeation enhancer when the pH elevates in the intestine (e.g., pH 6.8), which is crucial for maximizing permeation enhancement.||Conclusion As new molecular therapies become increasingly complex and clinical development timelines accelerate, formulators must move beyond conventional approaches. This involves defining clear problem statements, exploring multiple feasible solutions, and often opting for simplified formulations where it is possible to reduce risks and costs. Ultimately, resolving solubility and permeability concerns of challenging molecules demands creativity and the adoption of new technologies that simultaneously consider performance, manufacturability, stability, and patient needs. Ultimately, the optimal drug product uses the simplest technologies that meet both the target product profile and the patient’s needs, emphasizing a flexible, scalable, and commercially relevant design.||Contract Pharma is the premier media outlet linking contract service providers and their pharma/biopharma sponsors.||Copyright © 2025 Rodman Media.

Yizheng Cao: When ASDs are required, two well-established manufacturing technologies are spray drying (SDD) and hot melt extrusion (HME). While both are robust and scalable, their particle properties significantly influence downstream drug product design and performance. Spray Drying (SDD): Generates small, low-density particles with a high surface area. These particles are favored for rapid dissolution, high compressibility, and can achieve higher apparent solubility due to more extensive formation of drug-polymer colloids. However, their poor flowability often requires a densification process like dry granulation for downstream processing, which then improves tabletability. SDD is material-sparing and can be used at small scales, advantageous in early development. Hot Melt Extrusion (HME): Produces larger, denser particles. These particles typically exhibit better powder flow, making them potentially suitable for direct compression. However, their compressibility and tabletability may be limited, requiring further optimization or a lower drug loading in tablets. HME is a solvent-less process but requires more material for development and low-melting point components, with a risk of thermal degradation. The choice between SDD and HME depends on the specific molecule, program, and problem statement, as no single process is always superior; the pros and cons for process throughput, stability, particle engineering, bioperformance, and drug product design must be carefully considered.

The core idea is to employ a comprehensive strategy that considers not just the components, but also their processing, manufacturability, and targeted delivery. Key strategies for overcoming permeability challenges include: Intimate Mixing and Engineered Process Trains: Permeation enhancers need to be intimately mixed with the API, sometimes at a molecular level, for effective interaction with intestinal membranes. o   Spray Drying with Dry Granulation: This process begins by spray drying a dispersion of the API and enhancer, ensuring intimate mixing at a molecular level. Subsequently, a dry granulation step densifies the resulting powders, which often have poor flowability, and allows for the optional addition of more permeation enhancers. o   Wet Granulation: An alternative is to introduce peptides and enhancers as a solution into a wet granulation process. This ensures high uniformity and composition of the elements and produces a blend with excellent flowability, achieving both intimate mixing and improved powder properties in a single step. These methods help engineer powder properties to maximize drug loading. Simultaneous Release and Targeted Delivery: Effective permeation relies on the API permeating during a short window when the enhancer interacts with the intestinal membrane. o   Enteric Coating: To achieve this synchronized and targeted delivery, enteric coating is often applied to drug products (capsules or tablets). This pH-triggered coating prevents drug release in the acidic stomach and allows for a rapid and simultaneous release of both the API and the permeation enhancer when the pH elevates in the intestine (e.g., pH 6.8), which is crucial for maximizing permeation enhancement.

As market dynamics shift and expectations rise, Jones Healthcare Group is making targeted investments, expanding capacity, and deepening partnerships to help clients stay ahead.||We spoke with Mike Horsfield, Vice President, Business Development at Jones Healthcare Group, about the trends reshaping pharma packaging and how Jones is responding with agility, innovation and purpose.||Contract Pharma: What market shifts are driving packaging innovation right now?||Mike Horsfield: There’s a clear move toward smaller, more flexible formats—particularly in solid dose. Consumers are increasingly purchasing only what they need, favouring two- and four-count packs over bulk formats. This change reflects economic pressures, shelf-life considerations and evolving retail habits.||In Canada, regulatory discussions could soon allow more high-potency drugs to be sold beyond traditional pharmacies. If implemented, this would create new distribution opportunities, aligning Canada more closely with the U.S. model and enabling broader access to everyday health products in non-pharmacy environments.||For packaging providers, the challenge is to deliver solutions that are not only compliant but also adaptable to emerging retail formats and consumer expectations. These shifts are relevant across both consumer healthcare and prescription drug markets.||CP: How is Jones Healthcare responding to these shifts?||MH: We’ve made year-over-year investments to stay ahead of evolving market and client needs—adding new lines and upgrading sites annually since 2020. By next year, these investments will total $40 million. At our Toronto facility, we’ve most recently added a blister line tailored for mid-volume production, meeting the needs of brands that require lower minimum order quantities and greater flexibility. We’ve also approved a new vial line capable of producing both travel-size vials and small bottles, giving clients more format options.||While we may not invest in large-scale infrastructure all at once, our year-over-year approach ensures we’re continuously building capacity in line with client demand, without compromising quality or agility. These moves reflect our readiness to support both consumer healthcare and prescription drug packaging, ensuring clients have the resources and adaptability they need to seize growth opportunities as markets evolve.||CP: What sets Jones apart in a crowded packaging market?||MH: Our fully integrated model combines contract packaging with in-house print and board conversion. We can design board components, apply artwork, and run packaging on our lines—all under one coordinated operation. That means faster timelines, simplified workflows and consistent brand presentation.||Many providers outsource parts of this process. We control it end-to-end, which is rare in our industry. This integration allows us to respond quickly—whether to regulatory changes, new product launches or shifts in consumer demand.||Importantly, we’ve strengthened our team with new hires from leading prescription drug companies, bringing deep Rx experience to our operations. This bench strength supports our ongoing expansion into regulated pharma packaging with full serialization capabilities across multiple packaging formats.||CP: How does Jones approach innovation for pharma clients?||MH: Our innovation is grounded in curiosity, collaboration and real-world insight. We’ve delivered award-winning custom designs—from complex carton geometries to sustainable board-based formats. Our own adherence packaging portfolio, including Qube™ and FlexRx™, reflects our focus on purposeful innovation that improves health outcomes. We’re also preparing to launch the first fully recyclable medication adherence blister pack.||While our contract packaging work is typically client-specified, we continue to explore ways to apply innovations and new solutions in partnership with our contract packaging and print customers. By engaging suppliers, monitoring global trends and fostering cross-team creativity, we ensure innovation remains a continuous process—not an occasional event.||CP: What role does serialization play in your packaging strategy?||MH: Serialization is a critical requirement in regulated pharma packaging, and Jones is equipped to support it. We’ve implemented serialization capabilities that meet global compliance standards, ensuring traceability and product integrity across the supply chain.||While we’re best known for our work in consumer healthcare, serialization reinforces our readiness to serve prescription drug clients. It’s part of our broader commitment to quality, compliance and continuous improvement.||CP: What role does sustainability play in your packaging strategy?||MH: Sustainability is now a core business requirement. Clients want recyclable materials, monolayer films and reduced plastic content. While Europe leads in regulation, North America is quickly following.||We’re sourcing materials and developing designs that meet both environmental and regulatory requirements. For example, we’re investigating monolayer pouching films that simplify recycling and reduce waste. Our approach is pragmatic—sustainable packaging must perform, protect the product and work at scale. We help clients make responsible choices that align with their brand values and consumer expectations.||CP: What should U.S.-based decision-makers know about partnering with a Canadian provider?||MH: Canada’s retail and regulatory landscape is shifting. For U.S. companies, working with Jones offers advantages in navigating bilingual labelling, Health Canada requirements and smaller volume runs. We’ve led in extended content packaging, launching the first high-performance multi-panel folding carton meeting pharmaceutical critical-to-quality parameters when Health Canada’s Plain Language Labelling regulations rolled out. Our solutions add up to 55% more surface area for multi-lingual applications.||We work with the largest U.S. pharmaceutical brands and understand the cross-border nuances. With capacity and deep experience, we can help American teams execute seamlessly in Canada—and keep them informed about the market changes that matter most to their operations.||With proximity to key U.S. markets via the Niagara and Windsor bridges, Jones offers efficient access to Northeast and Midwest distribution hubs. This geographic advantage supports seamless cross-border logistics and faster speed to market.||Jones Healthcare Group isn’t simply reacting to change—it’s anticipating it. Through strategic investment, integrated capabilities and a deep understanding of regulated markets, Jones demonstrates how packaging can be more than a container—it can be a catalyst for growth, compliance and meaningful connection with consumers. Each investment is guided by market insight and client collaboration, ensuring we’re ready for what’s next—not just reacting to change.||Contract Pharma is the premier media outlet linking contract service providers and their pharma/biopharma sponsors.||Copyright © 2025 Rodman Media.

Released By Jones Healthcare Group September 9, 2025 In today’s pharmaceutical landscape, packaging has evolved beyond a technical necessity—it’s now a strategic driver of growth, compliance and consumer engagement. As market dynamics shift and expectations rise, Jones Healthcare Group is making targeted investments, expanding capacity, and deepening partnerships to help clients stay ahead. We spoke with Mike Horsfield, Vice President, Business Development at Jones Healthcare Group, about the trends reshaping pharma packaging and how Jones is responding with agility, innovation and purpose. Contract Pharma: What market shifts are driving packaging innovation right now? Mike Horsfield: There’s a clear move toward smaller, more flexible formats—particularly in solid dose. Consumers are increasingly purchasing only what they need, favouring two- and four-count packs over bulk formats. This change reflects economic pressures, shelf-life considerations and evolving retail habits. In Canada, regulatory discussions could soon allow more high-potency drugs to be sold beyond traditional pharmacies. If implemented, this would create new distribution opportunities, aligning Canada more closely with the U.S. model and enabling broader access to everyday health products in non-pharmacy environments. For packaging providers, the challenge is to deliver solutions that are not only compliant but also adaptable to emerging retail formats and consumer expectations. These shifts are relevant across both consumer healthcare and prescription drug markets. CP: How is Jones Healthcare responding to these shifts? MH: We’ve made year-over-year investments to stay ahead of evolving market and client needs—adding new lines and upgrading sites annually since 2020. By next year, these investments will total $40 million. At our Toronto facility, we’ve most recently added a blister line tailored for mid-volume production, meeting the needs of brands that require lower minimum order quantities and greater flexibility. We’ve also approved a new vial line capable of producing both travel-size vials and small bottles, giving clients more format options. While we may not invest in large-scale infrastructure all at once, our year-over-year approach ensures we’re continuously building capacity in line with client demand, without compromising quality or agility. These moves reflect our readiness to support both consumer healthcare and prescription drug packaging, ensuring clients have the resources and adaptability they need to seize growth opportunities as markets evolve. CP: What sets Jones apart in a crowded packaging market? MH: Our fully integrated model combines contract packaging with in-house print and board conversion. We can design board components, apply artwork, and run packaging on our lines—all under one coordinated operation. That means faster timelines, simplified workflows and consistent brand presentation. Many providers outsource parts of this process. We control it end-to-end, which is rare in our industry. This integration allows us to respond quickly—whether to regulatory changes, new product launches or shifts in consumer demand. Importantly, we’ve strengthened our team with new hires from leading prescription drug companies, bringing deep Rx experience to our operations. This bench strength supports our ongoing expansion into regulated pharma packaging with full serialization capabilities across multiple packaging formats. CP: How does Jones approach innovation for pharma clients? MH: Our innovation is grounded in curiosity, collaboration and real-world insight. We’ve delivered award-winning custom designs—from complex carton geometries to sustainable board-based formats. Our own adherence packaging portfolio, including Qube™ and FlexRx™, reflects our focus on purposeful innovation that improves health outcomes. We’re also preparing to launch the first fully recyclable medication adherence blister pack. While our contract packaging work is typically client-specified, we continue to explore ways to apply innovations and new solutions in partnership with our contract packaging and print customers. By engaging suppliers, monitoring global trends and fostering cross-team creativity, we ensure innovation remains a continuous process—not an occasional event. CP: What role does serialization play in your packaging strategy? MH: Serialization is a critical requirement in regulated pharma packaging, and Jones is equipped to support it. We’ve implemented serialization capabilities that meet global compliance standards, ensuring traceability and product integrity across the supply chain. While we’re best known for our work in consumer healthcare, serialization reinforces our readiness to serve prescription drug clients. It’s part of our broader commitment to quality, compliance and continuous improvement. CP: What role does sustainability play in your packaging strategy?

"https://www.contractpharma.com/library/ensuring-quality-flexibility-and-capacity-in-todays-drug-development-landscape/","Ensuring Quality, Flexibility, and Capacity in Today’s Drug Development Landscape | Contract Pharma","Timothy Compton of Alcami shares insight on Alcami's role in ensuring a smooth transition from development to manufacturing.||Today’s drug products require advanced development and manufacturing capabilities and flexibility to ensure quality and capacity needed in today’s CDMO landscape. Supporting drug programs across all phases is also increasingly important.||Alcami, a US-based contract development and manufacturing organization headquartered in NC, has evolved significantly over the years, from its origins as an analytical lab services provider, to growing its capabilities in sterile fill/finish, oral solid dose, clinical and commercial manufacturing, and storage.||Timothy Compton, Chief Strategy Officer at Alcami, shares insight on streamlining timelines and reducing risk, and Alcami’s integrated model—from early development through commercial manufacturing.||Contract Pharma: Alcami has evolved significantly over the years. From a strategic perspective, how would you define Alcami’s value proposition today in the CDMO landscape?||Timothy Compton: The value proposition of Alcami remains quality, flexibility, and capacity.  We operate under one, industry proven, quality system here at Alcami that supports our stellar regulatory track record for some 45 plus years.  Every program has its unique needs, timelines and deliverables which require flexibility of the CDMO to pivot where the program needs are and that’s a key attribute here at Alcami. We continue to experience strong year-over-year growth from returning customers and new customers alike and to meet the capacity demands of our customers, we also continue to expand. There are current expansions underway in the areas of analytical labs in support of biologics, new clinical/commercial sterile fill/finish capacity within our FDA audited facility, and continued expansion of GMP pharma/biopharma storage.  The Value proposition of Alcami is the same across all services, whether it’s Pharma Storage, Drug Product manufacturing or Lab Services.||Contract Pharma: While Alcami is well known for its analytical lab services, which the company was founded on in 1979 as AAIPharma, today what are some of the lesser known but equally critical services you offer earlier in the late phase development and commercial supply?||Timothy Compton: Yes, Alcami is well known for our analytical lab services, but perhaps the lesser known services are Sterile Fill/Finish and Oral Solid Dose Clinical and Commercial Manufacturing, and Pharma Storage.  All services can be provided as a standalone service offering or bundled together to develop and deliver clinical and commercial drug product.||Contract Pharma: Can you tell us about Alcami’s analytical testing and characterization capabilities—and how they play a role in ensuring a smooth transition from development to manufacturing?||Timothy Compton: A key component of all successful manufacturing programs is a strong and robust analytical package of test methods to characterize and release drug substances and drug product. We have one of largest and most talented analytical networks in the U.S.  It’s also a critical factor in the timely onboarding of drug product programs, whether developing methods for the first time or transferring late phase methods. At Alcami we have the bandwidth and capacity to start the analytical development or transfer the day we receive materials without delay or long lead time for resources. We support programs of all phases, whether first-in-human or tech transfer for commercial manufacturing and large or small molecules, there is very little that we can’t support with our Analytical team.||Contract Pharma: Stability storage and controlled storage environments are often overlooked but critical to success. How has Alcami built out its storage infrastructure to meet client needs?||Timothy Compton: Our Pharma/Bio Storage services is second to none here in the U.S. We operate more cold chain walk-in capacity than any other CDMO in the United States. One cold chain facility alone has walk-in storage (5C to -80C), yes -80C walk-in, equivalent to over 2,000 standard upright reach-in chambers. For business continuity, our walk-in chambers have triple redundant power/refrigerant back-up and multi-level security access with very tight tolerances. When it comes to stability storage, we offer multiple options and locations, from disaster recovery storage only to storage and testing (leveraging our analytical lab services). We currently have over 1,000 ongoing stability storage studies. We have immediate capacity to onboard storage to support the smallest or largest commercial needs.||Contract Pharma: Many biopharma clients are looking for integrated partners. How does Alcami’s integrated model—from early development through commercial manufacturing—help streamline timelines and reduce risk?||Timothy Compton: As mentioned earlier, we do operate under one quality system, that is the first and key step to being integrated across services. Leveraging all our services on a program allows for a number of opportunities to improve timelines. From storage and release testing of incoming materials (DS and components) at Alcami so materials are ready for manufacturing to packaging and labeling of drug product in parallel with the release of the batch. Keeping all the storage, testing, manufacturing, packaging and labeling under the control of one Project Manager and team has significant advantages.||Contract Pharma: Innovation is key to remaining competitive. What are some recent investments or innovations Alcami has made in capabilities, technologies, facilities, or people?||Timothy Compton: We continue to make investments across our company and people alike. We’ve expanded our leadership within drug product manufacturing this year with a few key hires and promotions to support the investments we’ve made in sterile fill/finish manufacturing. Those investments include the addition of new liquid and lyo vial filling within isolators that are Annex 1 compliant. We are focused on creating redundancy and scalability across all areas of our business. To support these efforts, we recently implemented and released SAP S/4HANA as our new ERP system.||Contract Pharma: What trends are you seeing from clients in terms of demand for development services, and how is Alcami adapting to meet those expectations?||Timothy Compton: A large push for U.S. development and manufacturing. Some factors driving this are Tariffs and the resurgence of the Biosecure Act, which have changed behaviors in the marketplace. CDMOs like Alcami, which have recently expanded their domestic capacity and bandwidth to onboard programs swiftly, are well-positioned to continue experiencing growth in 2026 and beyond.||Contract Pharma: Regulatory expectations are increasing, especially in analytical testing and data integrity. How is Alcami supporting clients in meeting these requirements during development?||Timothy Compton: Alcami’s analytical lab services services has been at the forefront of meeting these requirements and expectations, being an early adaptor of 100% paperless ELN system and with the implementation of LIMS via Waters NuGenesis.||Contract Pharma: As biopharma pipelines become more diverse—from small molecules to biologics and niche modalities—how is Alcami adapting its strategy and services to support a broader range of products?||Timothy Compton: Alcami has supported biologics programs for 20+ years but agree the new modalities and recombinant proteins continue to be a large part of the industry’s pipelines. From a storage perspective, we have significantly increased our capacity to store GMP materials at the cold or ultra-cold conditions all the way down to -135 C (LN2 storage). As a US-based CDMO we offer the largest amount of cold chain storage. Beyond storage, we the capability to aliquot/sample and test these materials within our internal lab network. From a manufacturing perspective, our new filling lines are completely single-use, provide low-line-loss with non-destructive weight checks and container-closure-integrity testing (CCIT) as each vial filled is a vial that can treat a patient.  Our biologics customers often ask how small a batch we can produce versus how large and we offer scalability from single liter to 1,000-liter batches.||Contract Pharma: Looking ahead, what areas of Alcami’s business do you expect to see the most growth in over the next few years?||Timothy Compton: Continued growth in biologics (storage, analytical lab services and drug product manufacturing), but without sacrificing the support of small molecules which still make up the largest segment of our industry. It’s a great time to be at Alcami and our growth over the next few years will be equally exciting.||Visit www.alcami.com to learn more >>||Contract Pharma is the premier media outlet linking contract service providers and their pharma/biopharma sponsors.||Copyright © 2025 Rodman Media.

Contract Pharma: As biopharma pipelines become more diverse—from small molecules to biologics and niche modalities—how is Alcami adapting its strategy and services to support a broader range of products? Timothy Compton: Alcami has supported biologics programs for 20+ years but agree the new modalities and recombinant proteins continue to be a large part of the industry’s pipelines. From a storage perspective, we have significantly increased our capacity to store GMP materials at the cold or ultra-cold conditions all the way down to -135 C (LN2 storage). As a US-based CDMO we offer the largest amount of cold chain storage. Beyond storage, we the capability to aliquot/sample and test these materials within our internal lab network. From a manufacturing perspective, our new filling lines are completely single-use, provide low-line-loss with non-destructive weight checks and container-closure-integrity testing (CCIT) as each vial filled is a vial that can treat a patient.  Our biologics customers often ask how small a batch we can produce versus how large and we offer scalability from single liter to 1,000-liter batches. Contract Pharma: Looking ahead, what areas of Alcami’s business do you expect to see the most growth in over the next few years? Timothy Compton: Continued growth in biologics (storage, analytical lab services and drug product manufacturing), but without sacrificing the support of small molecules which still make up the largest segment of our industry. It’s a great time to be at Alcami and our growth over the next few years will be equally exciting.

August 18, 2025 By: Rachel Klemovitch Assistant Editor Upperton Pharma Solutions, a UK-based CDMO, was awarded a grant as part of the first VaxHub Sustainable Platform Funding Call, in collaboration with the University of Oxford. The funding supports the development of an oral formulation for Adenovirus-vectored vaccines. Led by Professor Dame Sarah Gilbert at the University of Oxford’s Pandemic Sciences Institute, the project aims to address the limitations of intramuscular vaccine administration. By exploring oral delivery routes, the team seeks to induce mucosal immunity, improve vaccine stability, simplify distribution, and support self-administration. Upperton Pharma Solutions specialises in formulation development, clinical trial manufacturing, and manufacturing across various dosage forms, including oral solids, liquids, semi-solids, inhalation, and sterile products. With a 60,000 square foot facility in Nottingham, the company offers integrated CDMO services from pre-clinical development through to market supply. Upperton will apply its expertise in oral dosage form development, particle engineering, and spray drying to support formulation development work, enabling the next generation of Adenovirus-vectored vaccines to be delivered without needles, facilitating greater public acceptability and vaccine uptake. The VaxHub Sustainable Platform Funding Call, launched in January 2025, aims to support innovative projects aligned with sustainable vaccine development. The joint project is expected to be completed in summer 2026. VaxHub Sustainable is a research initiative funded by the UK’s EPSRC. Co-led by Prof Martina Micheletti (UCL) and Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert (Oxford), to position the UK as a global leader in sustainable vaccine manufacturing. This work is supported by funding from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) for the Manufacturing Research Hub for a Sustainable Future (VaxHub Sustainable), co-directed by University College London and the University of Oxford, with UK university partners is gratefully acknowledged (Grant Reference: EP/X038181/1).

"https://www.contractpharma.com/exclusives/how-ai-is-transforming-drug-safety-for-the-outsourced-pharmaceutical-ecosystem/","How AI is Transforming Drug Safety for the Outsourced Pharmaceutical Ecosystem | Contract Pharma","Moving beyond manual monitoring, supporting regulatory readiness, and the future of safety intelligence.||Practice Leader, Pharmacovigilance Technology Solutions at IQVIA||In the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry, patient safety is a steadfast non-negotiable. Whether it is in the development of a novel therapy or the manufacturing of an established drug, the responsibility to monitor, detect, and respond to safety issues is paramount for retaining trust and regulatory compliance. However, the complexity of achieving and maintaining this goal within today’s life sciences environment is greatly increasing. This is especially true when manufacturing and clinical trial operations span multiple geographies, partners, and regulatory frameworks.||The reality we face today is that the scale and variety of safety-related data has outpaced traditional monitoring methods. Call center transcripts, social media posts, chatbot interactions, adverse event reports, and even patient feedback collected by third-party vendors are all torrential streams of data that contribute to a vast pool of unstructured information. Buried within these sources are critical safety signals, early indicators of issues that could affect patient health or product quality. Yet without the right tools, much of this data goes under analyzed, delaying intervention and increasing risk.||The challenge is no longer a lack of data, but how to cut through the noise to find and act on the insights that matter.||The pressures on safety teams come at a time when drug development costs are also at record highs. The average cost to develop a drug has risen to $2.2 billion in 2024, up from $2.1 billion in 2023. These figures indicate the growing demand for new levels of efficiency at every stage of the value chain, including safety monitoring. Delays or inefficiencies in pharmacovigilance (PV) can trigger a domino effect that includes costly setbacks to an already expensive development process. This is driving demand to adopt tools that streamline the path from detection to resolution.||To chart a streamlined path forward, PV teams must explore practical ways to leverage artificial intelligence. According to McKinsey, the broader economic potential of AI in the pharmaceutical and medical products sector is estimated at $60–110 billion annually, largely driven from efficiencies in discovery, development, and operations. Within the clinical development space alone, the projected impact is a $13–25 billion per year, enabled by improvements in trial design, accelerated patient recruitment, and more efficient data analysis. For safety teams, capturing even a fraction of this potential means accelerating workflows, eliminating bottlenecks, and enhancing decision-making in ways that directly protect patients while reducing operational costs.||Regulatory agencies are also advocating for innovation in safety monitoring. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration established the Emerging Drug Safety Technology Program (EDSTP) in response to the growing challenges faced by both industry and regulatory authorities in the timely and efficient collection, processing, and evaluation of individual and aggregate patient safety data, which are further compounded by ever-increasing case volumes. This reflects a growing consensus that next-generation tools will be essential for managing the scale and complexity of modern safety demands.||Historically, pharmacovigilance and product safety teams have relied heavily on manual review processes. Analysts would read through reports, transcribe call logs, and flag items for further investigation. While effective at small scale, these methods buckle under the weight of today’s data volumes. A global portfolio of products could easily generate thousands of safety-relevant interactions each week, more than any human team can reasonably process without automation.||AI-powered technologies, such as natural language processing (NLP) and voice-to-text conversion, suggest a new workflow. These tools can rapidly process unstructured inputs, converting audio calls to text, extracting relevant medical terms, and identifying adverse event patterns across millions of data points. The result is a faster, more consistent method to detect potential safety issues.||For pharmaceutical organizations, this is not just a matter of operational efficiency. It is an opportunity to strengthen client partnerships by offering higher-quality safety monitoring as part of the service portfolio. The ability to assure customers that every piece of patient feedback is analyzed for risk, no matter the language, source, or format, can be a powerful differentiator in a competitive market.||Automation is only the first step in pharmacovigilance innovation, with the next frontier being intelligence that can act. Modern AI tools in the safety space are evolving from passive assistance to active participation. Instead of solely presenting a list of potential issues for human review, these systems can flag incomplete or inaccurate reports before they ever reach regulators. They can trace recurring problems back to their root causes, suggest corrective actions, and even prioritize cases based on severity or regulatory deadlines.||In a manufacturing or clinical trial environment where multiple stakeholders contribute to safety reporting, this level of intelligence can prevent costly missteps. For example, if a safety report submitted by a regional partner is missing required patient demographics, the AI system can automatically flag it for completion, saving time and avoiding regulatory delays. Similarly, if recurring quality issues are traced to a specific batch or packaging process, AI can identify the pattern and recommend targeted process adjustments.||Compliance is a responsibility shared between contract service providers and their clients. Yet the distributed nature of outsourced pharma operations can make regulatory readiness more challenging. When multiple organizations, each with their own systems and processes, are involved in collecting and submitting safety data, inconsistencies are inevitable.||Here, AI-driven workflows can help create a standardized, auditable safety process across the supply chain. By embedding signal detection tools directly into safety operations, companies can ensure that every piece of data passes through the same rigorous checks. This not only reduces the risk of non-compliance but also makes it easier to demonstrate due diligence during audits or inspections.||For decision-makers in outsourcing and supply chain management, this capability is critical. Regulatory scrutiny is intensifying worldwide, and the expectation is that all partners in the value chain are equally accountable for patient safety. Having AI-enabled processes in place demonstrates a proactive approach to meeting these expectations.||Cost efficiency is another compelling reason for pharma organizations to embrace AI in safety operations. Manual safety review is resource intensive. With skilled pharmacovigilance professionals in short supply, dedicating them to low-value tasks like sorting through non-relevant reports wastes talent and budget.||AI helps by triaging cases, prioritizing those that truly need expert review, and automating the handling of lower-risk or duplicate reports. This enables safety teams to focus their expertise on the complex cases that require human judgment, while reducing the burden of unnecessary manual processing.||In pharmaceutical manufacturing these savings can be significant. More importantly, they can be achieved without compromising patient safety or product quality.||The shift from manual review to automated detection, and now to intelligent action, is reshaping how the pharma supply chain approaches safety. But technology alone is not enough. Successful adoption requires cross-functional alignment between safety, quality, manufacturing, and regulatory teams, both within the contract service provider and across client organizations. It also demands standardized data practices to ensure AI tools have clean, consistent inputs from all sources, as well as clear escalation protocols, so that when AI flags an issue, the right people can respond quickly.||As the volume and complexity of safety data continues to grow, the organizations that can harness AI to transform that data into timely, actionable intelligence will be best positioned to meet regulatory demands, protect patients, and strengthen client trust. For contract pharmaceutical companies, this represents not just a technological evolution but a strategic opportunity. By embedding AI-enabled safety intelligence into core operations, CDMOs can move from being service providers to being trusted safety partners, delivering not only products but also peace of mind.||Updesh Dosanjh is responsible for developing IQVIA’s overarching strategy regarding AI and machine learning as it relates to safety and pharmacovigilance.

The ability to assure customers that every piece of patient feedback is analyzed for risk, no matter the language, source, or format, can be a powerful differentiator in a competitive market. From automation to intelligent action Automation is only the first step in pharmacovigilance innovation, with the next frontier being intelligence that can act. Modern AI tools in the safety space are evolving from passive assistance to active participation. Instead of solely presenting a list of potential issues for human review, these systems can flag incomplete or inaccurate reports before they ever reach regulators. They can trace recurring problems back to their root causes, suggest corrective actions, and even prioritize cases based on severity or regulatory deadlines. In a manufacturing or clinical trial environment where multiple stakeholders contribute to safety reporting, this level of intelligence can prevent costly missteps. For example, if a safety report submitted by a regional partner is missing required patient demographics, the AI system can automatically flag it for completion, saving time and avoiding regulatory delays. Similarly, if recurring quality issues are traced to a specific batch or packaging process, AI can identify the pattern and recommend targeted process adjustments. Supporting regulatory readiness across partnerships Compliance is a responsibility shared between contract service providers and their clients. Yet the distributed nature of outsourced pharma operations can make regulatory readiness more challenging. When multiple organizations, each with their own systems and processes, are involved in collecting and submitting safety data, inconsistencies are inevitable. Here, AI-driven workflows can help create a standardized, auditable safety process across the supply chain. By embedding signal detection tools directly into safety operations, companies can ensure that every piece of data passes through the same rigorous checks. This not only reduces the risk of non-compliance but also makes it easier to demonstrate due diligence during audits or inspections. For decision-makers in outsourcing and supply chain management, this capability is critical. Regulatory scrutiny is intensifying worldwide, and the expectation is that all partners in the value chain are equally accountable for patient safety. Having AI-enabled processes in place demonstrates a proactive approach to meeting these expectations. Cutting costs without cutting corners Cost efficiency is another compelling reason for pharma organizations to embrace AI in safety operations. Manual safety review is resource intensive. With skilled pharmacovigilance professionals in short supply, dedicating them to low-value tasks like sorting through non-relevant reports wastes talent and budget. AI helps by triaging cases, prioritizing those that truly need expert review, and automating the handling of lower-risk or duplicate reports. This enables safety teams to focus their expertise on the complex cases that require human judgment, while reducing the burden of unnecessary manual processing. In pharmaceutical manufacturing these savings can be significant. More importantly, they can be achieved without compromising patient safety or product quality. Building the future of safety intelligence The shift from manual review to automated detection, and now to intelligent action, is reshaping how the pharma supply chain approaches safety. But technology alone is not enough. Successful adoption requires cross-functional alignment between safety, quality, manufacturing, and regulatory teams, both within the contract service provider and across client organizations. It also demands standardized data practices to ensure AI tools have clean, consistent inputs from all sources, as well as clear escalation protocols, so that when AI flags an issue, the right people can respond quickly. As the volume and complexity of safety data continues to grow, the organizations that can harness AI to transform that data into timely, actionable intelligence will be best positioned to meet regulatory demands, protect patients, and strengthen client trust. For contract pharmaceutical companies, this represents not just a technological evolution but a strategic opportunity. By embedding AI-enabled safety intelligence into core operations, CDMOs can move from being service providers to being trusted safety partners, delivering not only products but also peace of mind.

September 25, 2025 By: Updesh Dosanjh Practice Leader, Pharmacovigilance Technology Solutions at IQVIA In the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industry, patient safety is a steadfast non-negotiable. Whether it is in the development of a novel therapy or the manufacturing of an established drug, the responsibility to monitor, detect, and respond to safety issues is paramount for retaining trust and regulatory compliance. However, the complexity of achieving and maintaining this goal within today’s life sciences environment is greatly increasing. This is especially true when manufacturing and clinical trial operations span multiple geographies, partners, and regulatory frameworks. The reality we face today is that the scale and variety of safety-related data has outpaced traditional monitoring methods. Call center transcripts, social media posts, chatbot interactions, adverse event reports, and even patient feedback collected by third-party vendors are all torrential streams of data that contribute to a vast pool of unstructured information. Buried within these sources are critical safety signals, early indicators of issues that could affect patient health or product quality. Yet without the right tools, much of this data goes under analyzed, delaying intervention and increasing risk. The challenge is no longer a lack of data, but how to cut through the noise to find and act on the insights that matter. Escalating costs and increasing complexity The pressures on safety teams come at a time when drug development costs are also at record highs. The average cost to develop a drug has risen to $2.2 billion in 2024, up from $2.1 billion in 2023. These figures indicate the growing demand for new levels of efficiency at every stage of the value chain, including safety monitoring. Delays or inefficiencies in pharmacovigilance (PV) can trigger a domino effect that includes costly setbacks to an already expensive development process. This is driving demand to adopt tools that streamline the path from detection to resolution. AI as a value multiplier To chart a streamlined path forward, PV teams must explore practical ways to leverage artificial intelligence. According to McKinsey, the broader economic potential of AI in the pharmaceutical and medical products sector is estimated at $60–110 billion annually, largely driven from efficiencies in discovery, development, and operations. Within the clinical development space alone, the projected impact is a $13–25 billion per year, enabled by improvements in trial design, accelerated patient recruitment, and more efficient data analysis. For safety teams, capturing even a fraction of this potential means accelerating workflows, eliminating bottlenecks, and enhancing decision-making in ways that directly protect patients while reducing operational costs. Regulatory momentum Regulatory agencies are also advocating for innovation in safety monitoring. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration established the Emerging Drug Safety Technology Program (EDSTP) in response to the growing challenges faced by both industry and regulatory authorities in the timely and efficient collection, processing, and evaluation of individual and aggregate patient safety data, which are further compounded by ever-increasing case volumes. This reflects a growing consensus that next-generation tools will be essential for managing the scale and complexity of modern safety demands. Moving beyond manual monitoring Historically, pharmacovigilance and product safety teams have relied heavily on manual review processes. Analysts would read through reports, transcribe call logs, and flag items for further investigation. While effective at small scale, these methods buckle under the weight of today’s data volumes. A global portfolio of products could easily generate thousands of safety-relevant interactions each week, more than any human team can reasonably process without automation. AI-powered technologies, such as natural language processing (NLP) and voice-to-text conversion, suggest a new workflow. These tools can rapidly process unstructured inputs, converting audio calls to text, extracting relevant medical terms, and identifying adverse event patterns across millions of data points. The result is a faster, more consistent method to detect potential safety issues. For pharmaceutical organizations, this is not just a matter of operational efficiency. It is an opportunity to strengthen client partnerships by offering higher-quality safety monitoring as part of the service portfolio. The ability to assure customers that every piece of patient feedback is analyzed for risk, no matter the language, source, or format, can be a powerful differentiator in a competitive market.

Unlike traditional pharmaceuticals, these drugs used for diagnostic and therapeutic applications contain radioactive isotopes with very short half-lives. This creates a race against time, where every minute from production to patient administration is critical. The radiopharmaceutical revolution is not just about the development of new drugs, but also about the complex logistical network that makes their use possible, ensuring these life-saving treatments are delivered at the destination to trained personnel safely and on time for maximum efficacy.||The first major challenge in radiopharmaceutical logistics is the time-critical nature of the products. Many of the isotopes have half-lives measured in hours, while others are measured in minutes, like Flourine-18 (F-18) with a 110-minute half-life. This means a drug produced in a cyclotron facility must be synthesized, quality-checked, packaged and transported to the hospital or administration site within a very narrow window. The clock starts ticking the moment the isotope is created. This compressed timeline has given way to an “on-demand” production model, where drugs are manufactured specifically for a patient’s scheduled appointment. A single delay in any part of the process, from a traffic jam to a flight delay, could render the drug unusable, resulting in missing critical drugs for the patient and wasted high-cost resources.||To overcome this, the logistics network must be a finely tuned machine, leveraging a precise combination of air and ground transportation working in tandem. Specialized courier services, often with dedicated fleets and team members are the backbone of this system. Couriers receive special training to handle radioactive materials and understand the regulations from various agencies, including the Department of Transportation, IAEA and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which governs the packaging, labeling, and transportation. The packaging itself is a critical component, using lead-lined containers and other shielding to protect handlers and the public from radiation exposure while also maintaining the integrity of the product.||Another significant hurdle is the cold chain management required for many radiopharmaceuticals. While all radiopharmaceuticals are time-sensitive, some also require strict temperature control. This adds another layer of complexity to logistics. The insulated packaging must maintain consistent temperature, often refrigerated. This dual requirement for containment and temperature control means the packaging must be carefully designed and validated. Logisticians must monitor these shipments in real-time, using validated, specialized sensors and tracking software to ensure both temperature and location are within acceptable parameters throughout the journey. Any deviation from the prescribed temperature range may compromise the drug’s effectiveness, making it a critical quality control point.||The final mile of delivery presents its own set of challenges. When the radiopharmaceutical arrives at a hospital or clinic, it is simply not dropped off. It is delivered directly to a licensed professional (e.g., nuclear pharmacist), who immediately takes over the chain of custody. The delivery and reception process is meticulously documented to track the remaining radioactivity and ensure regulatory compliance. This hand-off is a high-stakes moment, as it’s the final opportunity to verify the drug’s integrity before it is administered to the patient. The logistical revolution in this field has seen the implementation of advanced software systems to provide real-time tracking, dose decay calculations, and automated alerts to all parties involved, from the production facility to the hospital pharmacy.||Understanding the challenges for shipping radiopharmaceuticals illustrates the transformative nature caused by the rise of this market, driven by the convergence of three crucial forces: the exponential growth of radiopharmaceuticals, their increase in recognition by global regulatory frameworks, and the rise of technological innovation that is redefining packaging and cold chain infrastructure.||In essence, the logistics of radiopharmaceuticals are a testament to the power of precision, collaboration, and technology.

Another significant hurdle is the cold chain management required for many radiopharmaceuticals. While all radiopharmaceuticals are time-sensitive, some also require strict temperature control. This adds another layer of complexity to logistics. The insulated packaging must maintain consistent temperature, often refrigerated. This dual requirement for containment and temperature control means the packaging must be carefully designed and validated. Logisticians must monitor these shipments in real-time, using validated, specialized sensors and tracking software to ensure both temperature and location are within acceptable parameters throughout the journey. Any deviation from the prescribed temperature range may compromise the drug’s effectiveness, making it a critical quality control point.  The final mile of delivery presents its own set of challenges. When the radiopharmaceutical arrives at a hospital or clinic, it is simply not dropped off. It is delivered directly to a licensed professional (e.g., nuclear pharmacist), who immediately takes over the chain of custody. The delivery and reception process is meticulously documented to track the remaining radioactivity and ensure regulatory compliance. This hand-off is a high-stakes moment, as it’s the final opportunity to verify the drug’s integrity before it is administered to the patient. The logistical revolution in this field has seen the implementation of advanced software systems to provide real-time tracking, dose decay calculations, and automated alerts to all parties involved, from the production facility to the hospital pharmacy.  Understanding the challenges for shipping radiopharmaceuticals illustrates the transformative nature caused by the rise of this market, driven by the convergence of three crucial forces: the exponential growth of radiopharmaceuticals, their increase in recognition by global regulatory frameworks, and the rise of technological innovation that is redefining packaging and cold chain infrastructure.  In essence, the logistics of radiopharmaceuticals are a testament to the power of precision, collaboration, and technology. It’s a field where the consequences of failure are not simply financial but could mean the difference between a successful medical procedure and a missed opportunity for a patient in need. As the number of new radiopharmaceutical treatments continues to grow, so will the demands on this specialized supply chain. The revolution is not just in the drugs themselves, but in the intelligent and intricate systems that ensure they can be delivered to the right patient at the right time, making life saving treatments a reality.

In this competitive market, ignoring the advance of AI is not an option. Instead, CROs need to take a strategic view of how new technologies can help transform their business models and enable them to move beyond the traditional revenue streams of monitoring and source data verification (SDV). CROs today need to leverage AI and advanced analytics to enhance study efficiency, protect data integrity and meet sponsor expectations.||Global regulators and sponsors are raising the bar when it comes to risk-based strategies. Around 8 in 10 industry leaders believe RBQM will improve the overall quality of research and more than 6 in 10 trust it will enable efficiency and cost savings2. ICH E6 (R3) pushes a unified risk-based model, expanding on the concept of centralized monitoring and its ability to identify systemic or site-specific issues. At the same time, sponsors are continuing to examine streamlining the integrated data review (IDR) process.||To be successful in this environment, and ensure readiness for what comes next, CROs need to embed risk-based strategies into operations. Moving from outdated methods to data-driven oversight will be vital, as will streamlining and simplifying the oversight and reconciliation process across teams. By taking these steps now, CROs can build more sustainable, long-term partnerships and ensure their long-term future.||Of course, AI will be central to this success. However, CROs also need to consider how to go beyond technology and lead organizational transformation that aligns people, processes, and platforms for regulatory-ready, data-driven trials.||The percentage of clinical trials implementing RBQM elements is expected to increase to 81% in execution and monitoring and 79% in documentation and resolution by 20273. With adoption on the increase, we need to stop thinking of RBQM as an alternative or optional way of operating within a trial and instead move to it as the standard operating model for trial oversight moving forward. This new era of integrated RBQM as a standard, will harness advanced technologies and incorporate central statistical monitoring (CSM) to transform how CROs detect, act on and learn from data.||CSM – an approach backed by the FDA4 – applies statistical algorithms to identify data outliers and discrepancies. By integrating AI thoughtfully, CROs can gain even deeper insights and create efficiencies. Ultimately this is about identifying and detecting data and quality issues with more speed and accuracy, increasing speed to market and delivering better outcomes for patients and sponsors.||The addition of AI-driven tools to Integrated Data Review is already unlocking deeper oversights, accelerating timelines and automating previously labor-intensive processes. CROs need to seize these opportunities as the market continues to standardize this approach.||Traditional site monitoring is one of the most expensive components of clinical trials with onsite monitoring alone accounting for up to 30% of total trial expenses5. CROs can improve their ability to evaluate the performance of clinical trial sites by adopting adaptive site monitoring. Adaptive site monitoring leverages advanced analytics and machine learning (ML) to move beyond traditional SDV methods, enabling more focused SDR, limited SDV and more efficient data locking strategies. This allows CROs to quickly to re-assess site monitoring priorities, simplify site visit planning, optimize site recruitment, evaluate clinical research associate (CRA) effectiveness across studies and mitigate inherent risks.||Another example of how RBQM can be enhanced with AI is medical coding. Auto coding tools typically successfully code just 50-60% of input terms. Use of a synonym library can increase this to around 70-80% but this is labor-intensive to build and maintain and still results in a significant proportion of codes requiring manual coding6. A deep learning (DL) model can offer precise, AI-generated coding suggestions for concomitant medications and adverse events at up to 99% accuracy. The model can automatically handle updates to the WHODrug and MedDRA dictionary and leverage semantics by using embeddings that encode the meaning of words. Combined, these advances can reduce the time taken to code medical data and adverse events by around 75%.||Medical review provides another practical example of the real-world applications of AI. Medical and safety reviewers have historically had to rely on manual processes to analyze patient data and safety outcomes. This can lead to errors and inefficiencies. An AI-powered process using specialized large language models (LLMs) can rapidly identify common outliers, enhance query management with clear status updates and integrate data review and query generation. This reduces manual workload, allowing data managers to improve oversight and empowering them to drive data quality and overall trial success.||CROs looking to succeed and differentiate in an increasingly pressurized and competitive environment need to think strategically about how to leverage AI and advanced analytics.||Future success will rely on going beyond risk detection to operationalize analytics, make proactive decisions, and resolve issues before they escalate.
